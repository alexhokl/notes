- [13 best practices for user account, authentication, and password management,
  2021
  edition](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/account-authentication-and-password-management-best-practices)
- One of the command practices is that there are no sign-up link/button in home
  page anymore and it will be on sign-in page instead.
- No email address confirmation field (repeating the entered address) should be
  used anymore. Instead, sending a email to the specified address should used
  and password creation should happen after the confirmation.
- No password rotation policy should be enforced. (ref: [Is password expiration
  no longer recommended?](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-FAQ/#q-b05))
- For new password field, `<input autocomplete="new-password" ...>` should be
  used to help password managers identifying the field.
- For current password field, `<input autocomplete="current-password" ...>`
- should be used to help password managers identifying the field.
- For email address field, `<input autocomplete="email" ...>` should be used to
  help password managers identifying the field.
- [Pwned Passwords](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords) can be used to check
  against new password entered by user and suggest against using it has been
  compromised.
- Password pasting should be allowed.
- Salt and hashing the password should be done at the backend
- Password hints should not be used to verify accounts (in case of forget
  password).
- URL `/.well-known/change-password/` should be implemented to redirect users to
  password change page. (for instance, `curl -i
  https://www.apple.com/.well-known/change-password`)
- Email address is preferred over username.
- Placeholders should not be used and labels next to the fields should be used
  instead.
- Show password button helps improving accessibility.

### Tools

- [cloudentity/oauth2c](https://github.com/cloudentity/oauth2c) - User-friendly

# OpenID

- the ID tokens issued are supposed to be used by client and should not be
  consumed by APIs
- this is effectively OAuth 2.0 but with additional scope of `openid` added in
  the authorization request
- this also avoid OAuth 2.0 to serve user information in the token flow (which
  was used by major authentication providers previously)

# JWT

### Abstract

- The claims in a JWT
   are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON
   Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web
   Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally
   signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code
   (MAC) and/or encrypted.

### Introduction

- JWTs are always
   represented using the JWS Compact Serialization or the JWE Compact
   Serialization.

### Terminology

- JSON Web Token (JWT) - A string representing a set of claims as a JSON object
  that is encoded in a JWS or JWE, enabling the claims to be digitally signed
  or MACed and/or encrypted.
- NumericDate - A JSON numeric value representing the number of seconds from
  1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC until the specified UTC date/time, ignoring leap
  seconds

### JSON Web Token (JWT) Overview

- The contents of the JOSE Header describe the cryptographic operations
   applied to the JWT Claims Set.
- If the JOSE Header is for a JWS, the
   JWT is represented as a JWS and the claims are digitally signed or
   MACed, with the JWT Claims Set being the JWS Payload.
- If the JOSE
   Header is for a JWE, the JWT is represented as a JWE and the claims
   are encrypted, with the JWT Claims Set being the plaintext encrypted
   by the JWE.
- A JWT is represented as a sequence of URL-safe parts separated by
   period ('.') characters.  Each part contains a base64url-encoded
   value.  The number of parts in the JWT is dependent upon the
   representation of the resulting JWS using the JWS Compact
   Serialization or JWE using the JWE Compact Serialization.

#### Example on JWS MACed using the HMAC SHA-256

Combination of the following 3 components

- base64 encoded UTF-8 JOSE headers
- base64 encoded JWT claim set
- base64 encoded HMAC SHA-256 signature (or value) of (ASCII(BASE64URL(UTF8(JWS
  Protected Header)) || '.' || BASE64URL(JWS Payload)))

### JWT Claims

- The Claim Names within a JWT Claims Set
   MUST be unique
- all claims that are not understood
   by implementations MUST be ignored.
- There are three classes of JWT Claim Names: Registered Claim Names,
   Public Claim Names, and Private Claim Names.
- See [registered claim names](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1)
  for a set of commonly used names

### Unsecured JWTs

- just leave the signature part empty

## JWS

- headers are union of the following two
  - JWS protected header
  - JWS unprotected header
- two types of serialisation
  - JWS Compact Serialization (probably the most common one)
  - JWS JSON Serialization
- header `crit` is an array and it specifies that the implementation must be
  able to understood and process this headers listed in the array

### JWS Compact Serialization

- no JWS unprotected header

### JWS JSON Serialization

- combination of the following components
  - `protected` - with the value BASE64URL(UTF8(JWS Protected Header))
  - `header` - with the value JWS Unprotected Header
  - `payload` - with the value BASE64URL(JWS Payload)
  - `signature` - with the value BASE64URL(JWS Signature)

# Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

## Links

- [Everything you should know about certificates and PKI but are too afraid to
  ask](https://smallstep.com/blog/everything-pki/)

## Certificate

A data structure that contains

- a public key and
- a name

The data structure is then signed. The signature binds the public key to the
name. The entity that signs a certificate is called the issuer (or certificate
authority (CA)) and the entity named in the certificate is called the subject.

X.509 v3 certificates is the most common form of certificates. Usually, it is
the PKIX variant described in [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280)
and further refined by the CA/Browser Forum’s Baseline Requirements. This is
the kind of certificates that browsers understand and use for HTTPS (HTTP over
TLS). There are other certificate formats.  Notably, SSH and PGP both have
their own.

If you’ve ever looked at an X.509 certificate and wondered why something
designed for the web encodes a locality, state, and country here’s your answer:
X.509 wasn’t designed for the web. It was designed in the 80s to build a phone
book.

There are a bunch of encoding rules for ASN.1, but there’s only one that’s
commonly used for X.509 certificates and other crypto stuff: distinguished
encoding rules (DER). You don’t have to worry much about encoding and decoding
DER but you definitely will need to figure out whether a particular certificate
is a plain DER-encoded X.509 certificate or something fancier. There are two
potential dimensions of fanciness: we might be looking at something more than
raw DER, and we might be looking at something more than just a certificate. DER
is straight binary, and binary data is hard to copy-paste and otherwise shunt
around the web. So most certificates are packaged up in PEM files (a base64
encoded payload sandwiched between a header and a footer). PEM-encoded
certificates will usually carry a .pem, .crt, or .cer extension. A raw
certificate encoded using DER will usually carry a .der extension. Again,
there’s not much consistency here, so your mileage may vary.

One of the common envelope formats is part of a suite of standards is called
PKCS (Public Key Cryptography Standards). When some things ask for “a
certificate”, what they really want a certificate in one of envelope formats.
[PKCS#7](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2315) can contain one or more
certificates (which can encode a full certificate chain). PKCS#7 is commonly
used by Java. Common extensions are `.p7b` and `.p7c`. The other common
envelope format is [PKCS#12](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7292) which can
contain a certificate chain (like PKCS#7) along with an (encrypted) private
key. PKCS#12 is commonly used by Microsoft products. Common extensions are
`.pfx` and `.p12`. Again, the PKCS#7 and PKCS#12 envelopes also use ASN.1. That
means both can be encoded as raw DER or BER or PEM (although it is using DER
most of the time).

If you’re lucky [RFC 7468](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7468) will give good
guidance to figure out what your PEM payload is. Elliptic curve keys are
usually labeled as such, though there doesn’t seem to be any standardization.
Other keys are simply “PRIVATE KEY” by PEM. This usually indicates a PKCS#8
payload, an envelope for private keys that includes key type and other
metadata.

It’s also quite common to see private keys encrypted using a password (a shared
secret or symmetric key). Those will look something like this (`Proc-Type` and
`DEK-Info` are part of PEM and indicate that this PEM payload is encrypted
using AES-256-CBC):

```console
-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
Proc-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED
DEK-Info: AES-256-CBC,b3fd6578bf18d12a76c98bda947c4ac9

qdV5u+wrywkbO0Ai8VUuwZO1cqhwsNaDQwTiYUwohvot7Vw851rW/43poPhH07So
sdLFVCKPd9v6F9n2dkdWCeeFlI4hfx+EwzXLuaRWg6aoYOj7ucJdkofyRyd4pEt+
Mj60xqLkaRtphh9HWKgaHsdBki68LQbObLOz4c6SyxI=
-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----
```

PKCS#8 objects can also be encrypted, in which case the header label should be
“ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY” per RFC 7468. You won’t have `Proc-Type` and `Dek-Info`
headers in this case as this information is encoded in the payload instead.

Public keys will usually have a `.pub` or `.pem` extension. Private keys may
carry a `.prv`, `.key`, or `.pem` extension.

## PKI

PGP uses certificates, but doesn’t use CAs. Instead it uses a web-of-trust
model.

### Web PKI

It is mostly defined by [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280) and
refined by the [CA/Browser Forum](https://cabforum.org/).

### Internal PKI

It is needed as Web PKI is not designed to support internal use cases.  With
Web PKI, you have little or no control over important details like certificate
lifetime, revocation mechanisms, renewal processes, key types, and algorithms.
The CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements actually prohibit Web PKI CAs from
binding internal IPs (e.g., stuff in `10.0.0.0/8`) or internal DNS names that
are not fully-qualified and resolvable in public global DNS (e.g., you cannot
bind a kubernetes cluster DNS name like `foo.ns.svc.cluster.local`). If you
want to bind this sort of name in a certificate, issue lots of certificates, or
control certificate details, you’ll need your own internal PKI.

## Trust & Trustworthiness

Relying parties, such as a browser, are pre-configured with a list of trusted
root certificates (or trust anchors) in a trust store.

Root certificates in trust stores are self-signed. The issuer and the subject
are the same. The signature on a self-signed certificate provides assurance
that the subject/issuer knows the relevant private key. A self-signed
certificate should only be trusted insofar as the process by which it made its
way into the trust store is trusted. On macOS the trust store is managed by the
keychain. On many Linux distributions it’s simply some file(s) in `/etc` or
elsewhere on disk. If your users can modify these files you better trust all
your users. Operating system trust stores typically ship with the OS. Firefox
ships with its own trust store (distributed using TLS from mozilla.org
— bootstrapping off of Web PKI using some other trust store). Programming
languages and other non-browser stuff like curl typically use the OS trust
store by default. Cloudflare’s `cfssl` project maintains a github repository
that includes the trusted certificates from various trust stores to assist with
certificate bundling.

There are 100+ certificate authorities trusted in the descriptive sense
— browsers and other stuff trust certificates issued by these CAs by default.
But that does not mean they are trustworthy in the moral sense. On the
contrary, there are documented cases of Web PKI certificate authorities
providing governments with fraudulent certificates in order to snoop on traffic
and impersonate websites. Some of these “trusted” CAs operate out of
authoritarian jurisdictions. The 2011 DigiNotar attack demonstrated
the problem here: as part of the attack a certificate was fraudulently issued
for google.com. This certificate was trusted by major web browsers and
operating systems despite the fact that Google had no relationship with
DigiNotar. DigiNotar root certificates were ultimately removed from the major
trust stores, but a lot of damage had almost certainly already been done. More
recently, Sennheiser got called out for installing a self-signed root
certificate in trust stores with their HeadSetup app, then embedding the
corresponding private key in the app’s configuration. Anyone can extract this
private key and use it to issue a certificate for any domain. Any computer that
has the Sennheiser certificate in its trust store would trust these fraudulent
certificates. This completely undermines TLS. Oops.

Certificate Transparency (CT) ([RFC 6962](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6962))
mandates that CAs submit every certificate they issue to an impartial observer
that maintains a public certificate log to detect fraudulently issued
certificates. A lot of certificate policy must be enforced by RPs, and RPs can
rarely be bothered. If RPs do not check CAA records and do not require proof of
CT submission this stuff does not do much good.

In any case, if you run your own internal PKI you should maintain a separate
trust store for internal stuff. That is, instead of adding your root
certificate(s) to the existing system trust store, configure internal TLS
requests to use only your roots. If you want better federation internally
(e.g., you want to restrict which certificates your internal CAs can issue) you
might try CAA records and properly configured RPs. You might also want to check
out SPIFFE, an evolving standardization effort that addresses this problem and
a number of others related to internal PKI.

## Certificate Authority

A CA is a trusted certificate issuer. It vouches for the binding between
a public key and a name by signing a certificate. Fundamentally, a certificate
authority is just another certificate and a corresponding private key that is
used to sign other certificates. A CA with a self-signed root certificate
included in trust stores is called a root CA. A root private key belonging to
a Web PKI root CA can only be used to sign a certificate by issuing a direct
command. Thus, web PKI root CAs cannot automate certificate signing. They
cannot be online. Web PKI root certificates are broadly distributed in trust
stores and hard to revoke. Best practice, therefore, is to keep root private
keys offline. To make certificate issuance scalable (i.e., to make automation
possible) when the root CA is not online, the root private key is only used
infrequently to sign a few intermediate certificates. The corresponding
intermediate private keys are used by intermediate CAs (also called subordinate
CAs) to sign and issue leaf certificates to subscribers. Intermediates are not
generally included in trust stores, making them easier to revoke and rotate, so
certificate issuance from an intermediate typically is online and automated.
The leaf is signed by the intermediate, the intermediate is signed by the root,
and the root signs itself.

When you configure a subscriber (e.g., a web server like Apache or Nginx or
Linkerd or Envoy) you will typically need to provide not just the leaf
certificate, but a certificate bundle that includes intermediate(s). PKCS#7 and
PKCS#12 are sometimes used here because they can include a full certificate
chain. When a subscriber sends its certificate to a relying party it includes
any intermediate(s) necessary to chain back up to a trusted root. The relying
party verifies the leaf and intermediate certificates in a process called
certificate path validation. Certificate path validation is the part of TLS
that does authentication. Encryption without authentication is pretty
worthless. It is like a blind confessional: your conversation is private but
you have no idea who is on the other side of the curtain.

## Key and Certificate Lifecycle

When a subscriber wants a certificate from a certificate authority, it
generates a key pair and submits a request to a CA. The CA makes sure the name
that will be bound in the certificate is correct and, if it is, signs and
returns a certificate. Historically, X.509 used X.500 distinguished names (DNs)
to name the subject of a certificate (a subscriber). One should not try to
field all the fields in DN. Usually, common name in DN is enough. PKIX
originally specified that the DNS hostname of a website should be bound in the
the DN common name. More recently, the CAB Forum has deprecated this practice
and made the entire DN optional. Instead, the modern best practices is to
leverage the [subject alternative name (SAN) X.509
extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_Alternative_Name) to bind
a name in a certificate. There are four sorts of SANs in common use, all of
which bind names that are broadly used and understood: domain names (DNS),
email addresses, IP addresses, and URIs. Note also that Web PKI allows for
multiple names to be bound in a certificate and allows for wildcards in names.
A certificate can have multiple SANs, and can have SANs like *.smallstep.com.

There is a slow but ongoing transition from RSA to elliptic curve keys (ECDSA
or EdDSA). If you decide to use RSA keys make them at least 2048 bits, and
don’t bother with anything bigger than 4096 bits. If you use ECDSA, the P-256
curve is probably best (`secp256k1` or `prime256v1` in `openssl`).

Once a subscriber has a name and key pair the next step is to obtain a leaf
certificate from a CA. The CA is going to want to authenticate (prove) two
things:

- The public key to be bound in the certificate is the subscriber’s public key
  (i.e., the subscriber knows the corresponding private key)
  - achieved via a certificate signing request
- The name to be bound in the certificate is the subscriber’s name
  - achieved by identity proofing or registration

Three types of identity proofing:

- domain validation (DV)
- organization validation (OV) - no one actually uses it
- extended validation (EV)

DV certificates bind a DNS name and are issued based on proof of control over
a domain name. Proofing typically proceeds via a simple ceremony like sending
a confirmation email to the administrative contact listed in WHOIS records. The
ACME protocol, originally developed and used by Let’s Encrypt, improves this
process with better automation: instead of using email verification an ACME CA
issues a challenge that the subscriber must complete to prove it controls
a domain. The challenge portion of the ACME specification is an extension
point, but common challenges include serving a random number at a given URL
(the HTTP challenge) and placing a random number in a DNS `TXT` record (the DNS
challenge).

To address the problem with organization validation (OV), CAB Forum introduced
EV certificates. They include the same basic information but mandate strict
verification (identity proofing) requirements. The EV process can take days or
weeks and can include public records searches and attestations (on paper)
signed by corporate officers (with pens). After all this, when you visit
a website that uses an EV certificate some browsers display the name of the
organization in the URL bar. Outside this limited use in browsers, EV
certificates are not widely leveraged or required by Web PKI relying parties.

For internal PKI you can use any process you want for identity proofing. If you
trust Chef or Puppet or Ansible or Kubernetes to put code on servers, you can
trust them for identity attestations. If you’re using raw AMIs on AWS you can
use instance identity documents (GCP and Azure have similar functionality).

Your provisioning infrastructure must have some notion of identity in order to
put the right code in the right place and start things up. And you must trust
it. You can leverage this knowledge and trust to configure RP trust stores and
bootstrap subscribers into your internal PKI. All you need to do is come up
with some way for your provisioning infrastructure to tell your CA the identity
of whatever is starting up.

X.509 certificates include a validity period. It is up to each RP to check
whether a certificate has expired.

If a key pair was used for signing/authentication (e.g., with TLS) one should
delete the private key once it is no longer needed. Keeping a signing key
around is an unnecessary security risk: it is no good for anything but
fraudulent signatures. If you have ever been told not to use the same key pair
for signing and encryption, this is the main reason.

There’s actually no standard renewal process for Web PKI. So the renewal
process is the same as the issuance process: generate and submit a CSR and
fulfill any identity proofing obligations.

For internal PKI, we can do better. The easiest thing to do is to use your old
certificate with a protocol like mutual TLS to renew. The CA can authenticate
the client certificate presented by the subscriber, re-sign it with an extended
expiry, and return the new certificate in response. This makes automated
renewal very easy and still forces subscribers to periodically check in with
a central authority. You can use this checkin process to easily build
monitoring and revocation facilities.

Let’s Encrypt makes automation easy and issues 90 day certificates, which is
pretty good for Web PKI. For internal PKI you should probably go even shorter:
twenty-four hours or less.

Like expiration, the onus is on RPs to enforce revocations. Unlike expiration,
the revocation status cannot be encoded in the certificate. The RP has to
determine the certificate’s revocation status via some out-of-band process.
Unless explicitly configured, most Web PKI TLS RPs do not bother. In other
words, by default, most TLS implementations will happily accept revoked
certificates.

For internal PKI the trend is towards accepting this reality and using passive
revocation. That is, issuing certificates that expire quickly enough that
revocation is not necessary.

## Using Certificates

- To configure a PKI relying party you tell it which root certificates to use
- To configure a PKI subscriber you tell it which certificate and private key
  to use (or tell it how to generate its own key pair and exchange a CSR for
  a certificate itself)

## TLS

TLS is successor of SSL (SSL 2.0 and SSL 3.0) and it has 4 versions.

- 1.0 (will be deprecated soon)
- 1.1 (will be deprecated soon)
- 1.2
- 1.3

# File types

### .csr (Certificate Signing Request)

Some applications can generate these for submission to certificate-authorities.
The actual format is PKCS10 which is defined in [RFC
2986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2986). It includes some/all of the key
details of the requested certificate such as subject, organization, state,
whatnot, as well as the public key of the certificate to get signed. These get
signed by the CA and a certificate is returned. The returned certificate is the
public certificate (which includes the public key but not the private key),
which itself can be in a couple of formats.

### .pem (Privacy Enhanced Mail)

Defined in [RFC 1421](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1421), [RFC
1422](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1422), [RFC
1423](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1423), [RFC
1424](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1424), this is a container format that may
include just the public certificate (such as with Apache installs, and CA
certificate files `/etc/ssl/certs`), or may include an entire certificate chain
including public key, private key, and root certificates. Confusingly, it may
also encode a CSR (e.g. as used here) as the PKCS10 format can be translated
into PEM. It is a base64 translation of the x509 ASN.1 keys.

### .key

This is a PEM formatted file containing just the private-key of a specific
certificate and is merely a conventional name and not a standardized one. In
Apache installs, this frequently resides in `/etc/ssl/private`. The rights on
these files are very important, and some programs will refuse to load these
certificates if they are set wrong.

### .pkcs12 .pfx .p12

Originally defined by RSA in the Public-Key Cryptography Standards, the "12"
variant was enhanced by Microsoft. This is a passworded container format that
contains both public and private certificate pairs. Unlike .pem files, this
container is fully encrypted. Openssl can turn this into a .pem file with both
public and private keys: `openssl pkcs12 -in file-to-convert.p12 -out
converted-file.pem -nodes`

### .der

A way to encode ASN.1 syntax in binary, a .pem file is just a Base64 encoded
.der file. OpenSSL can convert these to .pem (`openssl x509 -inform der -in
to-convert.der -out converted.pem`). Windows sees these as Certificate files.
By default, Windows will export certificates as .DER formatted files with
a different extension.

### .cert .cer .crt

A .pem (or rarely .der) formatted file with a different extension, one that is
recognized by Windows Explorer as a certificate, which .pem is not.

### .p7b

Defined in [RFC 2315](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2315), this is a format
used by windows for certificate interchange. Java understands these natively.
Unlike .pem style certificates, this format has a defined way to include
certification-path certificates.

### .crl (Certificate revocation list)

Certificate Authorities produce these as a way to de-authorize certificates
before expiration. You can sometimes download them from CA websites.

### PKCS #8

Defined in [RFC 5208](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5208). Technically, this is
not a file type but a syntax for storing private key information. It can be
encrypted with a passphrase using PKCS #5 (defined in [RFC
2898](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2898)). PKCS #8 private keys are typically
exchanged in the PEM base64-encoded format.

House](https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1558845973018906624)

- Use HTTPs
- Server render
- Store JWT/token in `secure`, `samesite`, `httponly` cookie to prevent XSS
- Declare content security policy (CSP) to prevent XSS
- Regen cookies when user auths (prevent session fixation)
- Set short cookie lifetime

## principles

- [defence in depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing))
- [principle of least
  privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege)
  * privilege granted for only during the time required
- separation of duties
  * separation of worker and approver
- secure by design (security is considered at all points of SDLC)
- KISS Keep it simple and stupid
  * one bad example is complicated password rules

## anti-patterns

- secure by obscurity (secret or closed source algorithms)
  * the opposite is [Kerckhoff's
    prinicple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle)

## fundamentals

- confidentiality
  * access control
    + authentication
    + authorization
  * encryption
- integrity
  * immutable logs
    + hash of log lines
  * immutable messages
- availablility
  * denial of service attacks

## frameworks

- [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)
  * [quick start
    guide](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/getting-started/quick-start-guide)

## domains

### identity access management (IAM)

- administration
- authentication
  * something you know
  * something you have
  * something you are
- authorization
  * for highly privileged user such as system admin or database admin,
    [PAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluggable_authentication_module) can be
    introduced to rotation of highly privileged credentials
- audit

### endpoints (client devices)

- controls
  * inventory
    + hardware
    + software versions
  * security policy
  * patching
  * encryption
  * remote wipe
  * location tracking
  * anti-virius / endpoint detection and response
  * disposal

### networks

- firewall
  * packet filtering (header filtering)
  * stateful packet inspection (payload filtering)
  * proxy
  * network address translation
- segmentation
  * bastion before a firewall
  * tri-homed (usually found in router at home)
    + cheap
    + easy to scale
    + single point of failure
  * basic DMZ
    + a set of servers between two firewall of either side
      + one side is internet; internal network on another
    + defence in depth
    + scalable
    + higher cost
    + higher complexity
  * multi-tiered DMZ
    + firewall before application (non-web server)
    + firewall before database
    + higher granularity
    + even better defence in depth
- VPN
  * application-specific
    + higher granularity
    + better control
  * network-based
    + simpler to implement
- secure access service edge (SASE)

### applications

- SDLC
  * linear
  * siloed
  * inflexible
  * DevOps practices makes the feedback loop in SDLC smaller
  * DevSecOps introduces security practices in all aspects of DevOps
- secure coding
  * coding practices
    + [owasp.org](https://owasp.org/)
  * trusted libraries
  * standard architecture
  * mistakes to avoid
    + [owasp top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
  * software build of material (to understand what is being used)
    + components
    + libraries
    + dependencies
    + versions
    + origins
    + vulnerbilities
- vulnerbility testing
  * static application security testing
    + white box apporach
    + source code scanning
    + finding vulnerbilities earlier
  * dynamic application security testing
    + black box approach
    + scanning a running application
    + finding vulnerbilities later

### data

- governance
  * policy (end goals)
  * classification of data
  * catalog (location of data)
  * resilience
- discovery
  * database
  * files
  * network
  * data loss protection (DLP)
- protection
  * encryption at rest
  * encryption in motion
  * key management
  * access control
  * backup
- compliance
  * report
  * retain necessary data for a necessary period
- detection
  * monitoring
  * user behaviour analytics (abnormal behaviour detection)
  * alerts
- response
  * case creation
  * dynamic playbook
  * automation of responses
  * orchestration of responses (needed before automation can be done)

## detection

- security information and event management (SIEM)
  * monitor
  * analyse
  * report
  * threat hunting (or attack detection)
    + results in early detection
- external detection response (XDR)
  * software is install on endpoint (client device)

## response

- incident response
  * more traditional
  * triage
  * remediate
- security orchestration automation and response (SOAR)
