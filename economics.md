___

# Basics

- as US bond price rises, it makes US currency stronger since investors have
  the intention to buy bonds in US dollars

# Behavioral Economics

- dictator game
  * altruism (maximizing the other's utility)
- present bias
  * weigh of present gain over future gain (assuming risk is the same)
  * naive on self-expectation
  * lack of self-control
  * short time desires derails long term goals
- systematic biases
  * using intuitions wuth cognitively demanding tasks
    + Bayesian probability
      + P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)
      + [example on drug testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem#Drug_testing)
- overconfidence
- preference are mealleable
  * same discount amount on different priced items presents different preferences
- anchoring effect
- social preferences
- situation matters

# Time preferences

- [discounted unitility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_utility)
  + maximization of discounted utility
  + [Fisher equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_equation)
- exponential discounting
  + a constant discount factor is easy to formulate
  + example
    + Student Amy considers writing her term paper today so as to give herself
    a single free evening in the future. Suppose
      + Instantaneous cost of writing the paper is 1 util (compared to an
        outside option)
      + Instantaneous benefit of a free evening is 4/3 utils
      + Daily discount factor is 0.9
      + utility function
        + free evening tomorrow => -1 + (0.9)(4/3) > 0
        + free evening in 2 days => -1 + (0.9)^2(4/3) > 0
        + free evening in 3 days => -1 + (0.9)^3(4/3) < 0 (not worth it)
  + reasons to against
- quasi-hyperbolic discounting
