## Transferring data out of EU

There are a few ways for a company complies with personal data protection
laws in EU and transferring the data out of EU.

> Usually this topic includes European Economic Area (EEA), which includes all EU
countries and non-EU countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.

There are the following options.

- [Adequacy Decisions](#adequacy-decision)
- [Standard Contractual Clauses](#standard-contractual-clauses)
- [Binding Corporate Rules](#binding-corporate-rules)
- certification mechanism
- codes of conduct

### Adequacy Decision

A decision made by European Commission (and its European Data Protection Board)
and the effect of such a decision is that personal data can flow from the EU to
a third country without any further safeguard being necessary. Examples of such
countries include

- Israel
- Japan
- Korea
- Switzerland
- UK
- US

### Standard Contractual Clauses

#### General

These clauses (SCCs) are standardised and pre-approved model data protection
clauses that allow controllers and processors to comply with their obligations
under EU data protection law. They can be incorporated by controllers and
processors into their contractual arrangements with other parties, for instance
commercial partners. There is no obligation to use SCCs. The clauses can be used
on a voluntary basis to demonstrate compliance with data protection
requirements, in which case they require a binding contractual commitment to
abide by them.

#### Modifications and relationship with the other contractual provisions

The text of the SCCs may not be altered, except

- to select modules and/or specific options offered in the text
- to complete the text were necessary (indicated by square brackets)
  * for example, to indicate the competent courts and supervisory authority, and
    to specify time periods
- to fill in the Annexes
- to add additional safeguards that increase the level of protection for the
  data

The above adaptations are not considered as altering the core text.

When relying on SCCs, the parties should only agree the clauses that are
relevant for their situation. The modules and/or options that do not apply
should be deleted.

#### Changes to the parties

The docking clause is an optional clause by which the parties to the SCCs can
choose to agree that additional parties may join the contract in the future.
This provides the parties with additional flexibility in case of changes with
respect to the entities participating in the processing arrangement throughout
the life cycle of the contract (e.g. in case it becomes necessary to extend the
processing chain by including a further (sub-)processor).

A processor is required to provide the name(s) of the sub-processor(s) it
engages to the controller.

The processor has to specifically inform in writing the controller of any
intended changes of the agreed list of sub-processors, respecting an agreed time
period of notice. If the controller objects to the intended changes, the
processor may not engage the new sub-processor(s).

The SCCs do not specify the time period for the processor to notify the
controller of a data breach concerning data processed by the processor. Clause
9.2 of the SCCs indicates that this has to be done “without undue delay”. It is
therefore for the parties to determine this period taking into consideration the
particular circumstances of the data processing at stake.

Besides a review or an audit, can the processor demonstrate compliance with its
requirements under the SCCs by using adherence to an approved code of conduct
pursuant to Article 40 of the GDPR or an approved certification mechanism
pursuant to Article 42 of the GDPR to demonstrate to the controller that it
complies with its obligations that are set out in the SCCs and stem directly
from the GDPR. At the same time, this does not affect the possibility of the
controller to decide on a review or an audit of the processing activities
covered by these SCCs.

#### Data Transfers To Third Countries

The SCCs are designed for a commercial context and are not adapted for data
transfers to international organisations.

The SCCs combine general clauses applicable in all cases (e.g. Section I) with
four modules that are adapted to different transfer scenarios. The parties have
to choose the module that corresponds to their situation, in particular in light
of their different roles, i.e. whether they are controllers, processors or
sub-processors, and who acts as data exporter and importer.

- Module 1
  * applies to data transfers from a controller (the data exporter) to another
    controller (the data importer)
    + Example: a Swedish travel agency has a framework contract with a hotel
      chain to arrange accommodation for European tourists around the world. To
      transfer data of the guests to the chain’s booking centre (the data
      importer) based on the SCCs, the Swedish agency (the data exporter) should
      use Module 1.
- Module 2
  * applies to data transfers from a controller (the data exporter) to
    a processor (the data importer)
    + Example: a company in the Netherlands outsources its HR services to
      a provider in India. The Dutch company (the data exporter) should use
      Module 2 to transfer the data of its employees to the Indian provider (the
      data importer) based on the SCCs.
- Module 3
  * applies to data transfers from a processor (the data exporter) to
    a sub-processor (the data importer)
    + Example: a hospital in Germany shares blood samples with a laboratory in
      Poland for analysis. The Polish laboratory outsources some aspects of its
      work to an Indonesian institute specialising in genetic analysis, using
      the SCCs. The Polish laboratory (the data exporter) may use Module 3 to
      transfer the data to the Indonesian institute (the data importer).
- Module 4
  * applies to data transfers from a processor (the data exporter) to its
    controller (the data importer)
    + Example 1: a Moroccan company uses cloud services offered by a Luxembourg
      company to manage its customer database. The SCCs (Module 4) can be used
      by the Luxembourg company (the data exporter) to transfer the data from
      its server in Luxembourg (back) to the Morocco client (the data importer).

The requirements of Article 28 of the GDPR and the requirements for
international data transfers (Article 46 of the GDPR) have been incorporated
into Module 2 (controller-to-processor transfers) and 3 (processor-to-processor
transfers) of the SCCs. Thus, compliance to those articles are ensured.

#### Rights of EU citizen

In addition, under the GDPR and the SCCs, EU citizen have the right to obtain
information (e.g. on the data that is transferred, the purpose of the
processing, the recipients with whom the data has been or will be shared, and
the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority) from the entity
that is responsible for the processing of the data (i.e. the ‘controller’). In
particular, EU citizen can request information about the handling of the data,
including data transfers, from a data exporter acting as a controller pursuant
to Article 15 of the GDPR. If data has been transferred by a controller to an
entity outside the EEA that uses the data for its own purposes (i.e. as another
‘controller’), the data exporter will only be able to provide information about
its own activities (in addition to the fact that data is transferred outside the
EEA). However, in that case, EU citizen can exercise the right to obtain
information directly against the controller outside the EEA based on the SCCs
(Module 1, Clause 10 of the SCCs)

If several entities are involved in the processing of the data and a EU citizen
do not know who the controller is, the EU citizen can either contact (1) the
entity that has transferred the data (the data exporter) or (2) the entity
outside of Europe that has received the data (the data importer). If the entity
the citizen turned to is not able to respond to the citizen directly (because it
only acts as a service provider on behalf of the other entity), the SCCs require
both parties to cooperate to handle the request in an effective and timely
manner.

#### Obligations of data exporters and importers

The parties must clarify to which specific data transfers they intend to apply
the SCCs, in particular the categories of personal data that are transferred and
the purpose(s) for which they are transferred (Annex I.A and B). Moreover, the
parties need to clarify their respective roles (as “data exporter” or “data
importer”), including in case of subsequent changes based on the (optional)
docking clause (Clause 7), and, for data exporters located outside the EU but
covered by the GDPR (Article 3(2)), indicate their representative in the EU
designated pursuant to Article 27 of the GDPR. The parties also need to indicate
the competent supervisory authority/authorities, in accordance with Clause 13
(Annex I.C, see question 38 for more information on choosing the competent
authority).

In addition, while the SCCs set out general requirements with respect to data
security and the processing of sensitive data, these requirements need to be
further specified with respect to the data transfer at issue (Annex I.B and
Annex II). With respect to security, Annex II contains a list of examples of
possible measures that can be put in place. The parties are not required to list
each of these measures, but should describe those measures that are actually
implemented by the data importer to ensure an appropriate level of security.

The place to provide this specific information is the Appendix, which according
to Clause 1(d) forms an “integral part” of the SCCs. In filling out this
Appendix, the parties should carefully consider the “Explanatory Note” on top of
the first page of the Appendix and – specifically with respect to technical and
organisational (security) measures – at the beginning of Annex II.

#### Local laws and governments access

##### Schrems II judgment

In line with the Schrems II judgment (C-311/18) of the EU Court of Justice,
Clause 14 requires the parties to assess, prior to concluding the SCCs, whether
the laws and practices of the third country of destination applicable to the
processing of the personal data by the data importer, could prevent the latter
from complying with the Clauses. In carrying out this “transfer impact
assessment”, the parties should take into account, in particular, the specific
circumstances of the transfer (e.g. the categories and format of the data, the
type of recipient, the economic sector in which the transfer occurs, and the
length of the processing chain) and the laws and practices relevant in this
context. The latter assessment includes the applicable limitations and
safeguards with a view to determine in particular whether the laws and practices
do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to
safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) GDPR (in which case they
will not be considered as affecting compliance with the SCCs).

As regards the impact on compliance with the SCCs, the parties may consider
different elements as part of an overall assessment (see Clause 14, Footnote
12); such as reliable information on the application of the law in practice
(such as case law and reports by independent oversight bodies), the existence or
absence of requests in the same sector and, under strict conditions, the
documented practical experience of the data exporter and/or data importer. In
case of a negative assessment, the parties may only transfer data based on the
SCCs if they put in place additional (“supplementary”) safeguards (e.g.
technical measures to ensure data security, such as e.g. end-toend encryption)
that address the situation and thus ensure compliance with the Clauses. The same
applies if the data exporter later on becomes aware that the data importer is no
longer able to comply with the SCCs, including following a change in the laws of
the third country. The data exporter will be required to suspend the transfer if
it considers that no appropriate safeguards can be ensured, or if so instructed
by the competent supervisory authority.

##### Requests for disclosure from public authorities

The SCCs contain requirements for the data importer to inform about government
access to the data that has been transferred.

According to Clause 15.1, the data importer should promptly notify the data
exporter if it receives a legally binding request from a public authority or
court in the third country to disclose the personal data transferred. Similarly,
it should notify the exporter if it becomes aware of any direct access (e.g.
interception) by public authorities to such data. In this respect, the SCCs take
into account that the data importer may be prohibited by its national law to
provide (certain) information to the data exporter. In particular, if the data
importer is not allowed to notify about specific instances of government access,
it should use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with
a view to communicating as much information as possible, as soon as possible. In
case the data exporter is itself a processor, it has to forward the notification
to its controller.

In addition, the data importer should provide the data exporter at regular
intervals with aggregate information about access requests it has received
(Clause 15.1(c)). This obligation again only applies if the importer is allowed
under its national law to provide such information. In case the data exporter is
itself a processor, it shall forward this information to its controller.

The SCCs contain additional notification requirements in case the data importer
becomes subject to laws and/or practices that prevent it from complying with the
Clauses.

The SCCs again take into account that the data importer may not be allowed under
its national law to inform about specific government access requests/direct
access. In particular, Clause 16(a) contains a general notification requirement,
according to the data importer must promptly inform the data exporter if it is
unable to comply with the Clauses, for whatever reason.

In accordance with Clause 15.1(a), the data importer has to notify the concerned
individuals if it receives a legally binding request from a public authority or
court in the third country to disclose personal data concerning them. In
addition, it may be difficult in practice to contact the concerned individuals
(e.g. because the data importer has no direct relationship with the
individuals). In this respect, Clause 15.1(a) makes clear that the data importer
may use the help of the data exporter (who may have a direct relationship with
the individuals).

Data importer is NOT contractually required to challenge each request for
disclosure it receives from a public authority.

#### Annex II

Title of this annex is "technical and organisational measures including
technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the data" and it
includes the following items.

- Measures of
  [pseudonymisation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonymization) and
  encryption of personal data
- Measures for ensuring ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and
  resilience of processing systems and services
- Measures for ensuring the ability to restore the availability and access to
  personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical
  incident
- Processes for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of
  technical and organisational measures in order to ensure the security of the
  processing
- Measures for user identification and authorisation
- Measures for the protection of data during transmission
- Measures for the protection of data during storage
- Measures for ensuring physical security of locations at which personal data
  are processed
- Measures for ensuring events logging
- Measures for ensuring system configuration, including default configuration
- Measures for internal IT and IT security governance and management
- Measures for certification/assurance of processes and products
- Measures for ensuring data minimisation
- Measures for ensuring data quality
- Measures for ensuring limited data retention
- Measures for ensuring accountability
- Measures for allowing data portability and ensuring erasure

Note that these items effectively composes Data Protection Impact Assessment.

#### Data subject

It refers to any identified or identifiable living individual to whom personal
data relates. This includes individuals who can be directly or indirectly
identified via an identifier such as a name, an ID number, location data, or
other factors specific to the person's identity.

#### Others

A modernized SCC has been developed in June 2021.

Together with ASEAN, European Commission has developed a guide (see references
above) that identifies commonalities between the EU standard contractual clauses
and ASEAN model contractual clauses, to assist companies present in both
jurisdictions with their compliance efforts under both sets of clauses. This
Guide will be complemented with best practices from companies that use these
contractual instruments for transferring data.

> ASEAN member states include Singapore and Indonesia

### Binding Corporate Rules

Binding corporate rules (BCR) are data protection policies adhered to by
companies established in the EU for transfers of personal data outside the EU
within a group of undertakings or enterprises. Such rules must include all
general data protection principles and enforceable rights to ensure appropriate
safeguards for data transfers. They must be legally binding and enforced by
every member concerned of the group.

Companies must submit binding corporate rules for approval to the competent data
protection authority in the EU.

GDPR](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/accountability-tools/bcr_en).
