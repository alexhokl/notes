### Managing a junior team

Reference: [Tweet by Gergely
Orosz](https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1459183541682593794)

- Coding
  - pairing less experienced engineers with the more experienced ones
  - supportive code reviews
    - not just offline ones, but talking code over
  - mob programming exercises
    - the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same
      space, and at the same computer. This is similar to pair programming.
- Engineering Practices
  - discuss what "quality" means in the team, and document them
  - define definition of done on a feature
    - discuss, document, follow.
- Training
  - complete relevant courses on technology used
    - summarise learnings
  - book club on a specific topic
- Getting things done
  - expose them to the business
    - product manager / designer / data scientist collaboration directly with
      people
    - share business goals, updates
    - team and org-wide demos
  - start small
    - give smaller, better defined tasks to them. this might mean cutting scope,
      and doing more pre-work (for you, the manager, and the PM)
  - mistakes, outages, bugs
    - expect them, and embrace them
    - do not create a culture of fear
- Expectations
  - career ladder: define what their level looks like, and what the next level
    is
  - competencies: define the dimensions on which they are evaluated (such as
    coding, architecture, execution, etc)
  - current situation: figure out (with them) where they are. Make a plan to
    close the most pressing gaps
- The hands-on manager
  - review their code, and work and give supportive feedback
  - where do they need the support to grow? can you help?
    - with direct feedback
    - with mentoring yourself
    - with connecting them with mentors
    - with pairing (and letting them drive)
- Be realistic
  - it will take time to grow
  - progress will be slower
  - set expectation upwards, and hold your back to your team
  - can you bring in seniors externally (such as contractors) for the sake of
    monitoring?
  - do celebrate progress and wins. one step at a time

### Leading engineering teams

Reference: [An engineering leader's journey
](https://icecrime.net/life/technology/an-engineering-leader-journey/) by Arnaud
Porterie

- common bottlenecks
  - insufficient clarity on strategy causing a lack of alignment toward
    priorities
  - excessive work in progress
  - a difficulty to move away from highly coupled historical systems all while
    keeping the business going
- ![heatmap of activity of teams in relation to business
  outcomes](https://icecrime.net/images/2020-10-19-an-engineering-leader-journey/heatmap.jpg)
- conclusions
  - Top-down initiatives are expected but having the majority of your product
    teams’ effort allocated to them is not a good sign: it begs the question of
    individual teams empowerment and the true autonomy of Product Managers.
  - The more initiatives a given team is contributing to, the more likely it
    will fail delivering on some combination of them. One can argue that a high
    number of small-ish things is fine, but experience shows it rarely is:
    context switching has a cost, and the likelihood of one of these small-ish
    things to reveal itself as a Pandora’s Box cannot be ignored.
  - For a given initiative, the number of impacted teams is of interest, if only
    as a proxy of the amount of coordination it will require, but more important
    is the existing contention of teams on its path. It sometimes takes a single
    team’s miss for an entire initiative to fail, and that risk grows as teams
    are spread thinner.
  - It’s a good model for examining roughly the “compatibility” of an initiative
    to be potentially started with the existing workloads on the team, or the
    inverse results of stopping one.
  - It’s a good model to support discussions of technical coupling and the value
    or architectural work (which could be the topic of an entire blog post
    itself) as it makes interdependencies more apparent.

### Leading Teams

- implement system and rules for teams instead of depending on skills of an
  individual leader as those skills could be limited in some areas and it could
  be hard to guess
- manager of managers to stand away most of the time (or away from day-to-day
  business) and observe but step in to give feedback and guidance afterwards
  (such as after a meeting or at the end of a week)
- psychological safety is about the absence of interpersonal fear
  * for example, pushing to something that is not technically possible
  * it is different from job security
  * with the safely, people will speak up and get give their opinion or asking
    questions
  * for those are quiet to give opinions, manager should provide the following
    + framing
      + giving context of the difficulty of the problem
    + inviting
      + not "are you with me?" but "is there anything we can do better?"
    + responding
      + responses do not spread fear in case of bad results
- if a manager can be super transparent about what his/her days and weeks look
  like to the team, it will help the team to understand the role of manager

### Company culture

Reference: [The patient change
agent](https://cutle.fish/blog/the-patient-change-agent)

##### Find out the problem

Observe for three months and try to answer the following questions.

- What forces are holding the problem in place?
- Who benefits from the status quo? Who will benefit from resolving the issue?
- Why wasn’t the org able to fix this?
- Does someone’s job involving fixing this? What is stopping them? Are they
  trying? Does someone’s job exist because this isn’t fixed?
- Are there benefits that I’m not seeing?
- How does change actually happen here?
- Has anything “worked”? Is there any momentum in terms of fixing the issue?
- Who has “skin in the game” vs. a secondhand interest in seeking improvement?
- Will anyone lose their job if the problem persists? Why?
- How is the status quo meeting people’s needs? Is there some shared vision of
  the future that might also meet people’s needs? Journaling helps you stay
  objective, and also gives you an outlet .

##### Run experiments

- The emphasis of an experiment is not on ensuring success or avoiding failure,
  but in allowing ideas that are not useful to fail in small, contained and
  tolerable ways
- Observable and time-bound. You’ll get data relatively quickly
- Involve invitation, not imposition
- Above all, the key thing here is to make them safe to fail. At no point should
  you put your job/career/well-being/sanity/relationships/enthusiasm in
  jeopardy. Never. It’s not worth it

##### Successful changes

- People will invite you to meetings to talk about it, and learn more about it
- Other parts of the organization will adopt it
- You’ll have volunteers to help you grow the idea
- Someone will try to take credit for it (a good sign)
- People will reach out to thank you
- It will grow organically and virally. You will sense the momentum and
  excitement. It will be palpable. No momentum... then it isn’t working.

##### Take stock

- Set a concrete stay/leave goal…if your “score” remains undecided (or less) for
  an extended period of time (e.g three months), consider leaving at your twelve
  month mark

### Planning

Reference: [How to plan?](https://kellanem.com/notes/how-to-plan)

#### some of the goals of planning

- communicate a shared goal and vision for everyone to pull towards
  * our vast and endless sea to yearn for
- list the projects that teams are going to work on, and the metrics they plan
  to move
- equip the business to estimate whether the projects and impacts are
  sufficient to meet the organization’s targets (growth, revenue,
  capabilities, etc)
- give leadership a venue to provide feedback, set direction and course correct

#### some rules of thumb for making planning

##### bottom up processes do not work

- there are a ton of critical insights we need from the people on the
  front lines doing the work, but bottom up planning is not how to get them
- individual teams, almost definitionally, are not in possession of the
  information and perspective to understand what is most important for the
  whole organization, and perforce will make locally optimal choices based
  on the information they do have
  * this may also mean more information should be shared to the team, if the
    team cares
- individual teams during planning will answer the question of what it would
  take them to accomplish a given goal, without awareness of what other
  teams will accomplish.
  * this may also mean sharing the work of a team to another team, if the
    other team cares
- the above two tendencies are a recipe for an organization that grows
  larger every year, but is largely maintaining the status quo
  * bottom up processes fall victim to anchoring
- In a bottom up process you ask people to spend time and energy advocating
  for what they think the right thing to do is, and what resources they need
  to do it. They naturally emotionally invest in that outcome.  This now
  becomes the floor for their expectations.

##### planning is the wrong time to introduce anything new

- most organizations have a formal period of time annually
- leadership often feels like Planning is their opportunity to introduce the new
  direction they would like to see the company move in
  * all this does is create a scramble, shallow thinking, and low quality plans
  * planning is when everyone is too busy to have these conversations
    + and too emotionally keyed up as they contemplate their budget for the
      coming year and what that means for their team
- instead, start working on new things when you are not Planning
  * document what you want to do/build/etc; share the proposal with people; get
    their explicit buy-in to support the new thing; Test your assumptions and
    estimates with people in your organization with expertise that are different
    from yours; get feedback from leadership about whether your idea is aligned
    with the direction of the organization (or if they are willing to change
    directions); tell people how much it is going to cost: in terms of people
    assigned to it, time to iterate on it, to break through the noise in the
    market and educate your target customers, etc; solicit internal interest for
    people who would be interested to join the effort if it gets approved; this
    is a Funding Proposal, and it is a great process to run outside of Planning
  * Funding Proposals can seem like a heavy process; it can take weeks or
    months; it is not something you can do within the constraints of a company’s
    annual Planning process
  * the other option that also works well for a large class of ideas: just try
    them. Don’t ask for resources, don’t ask for support from other teams, do
    the quick and dirty test to validate or disprove your idea, build a thing
    knowing that you will probably fail and be ready to back out your changes
    and throw it away. That is a great alternative to doing a real plan

##### provide frameworks and constraints

- doing top-down planning without micro-managing
- metrics are perennially popular constraints
  * revenue, [churn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churn_rate), sign ups,
    availability, etc are the bread and butter of many companies’ planning
    processes; consider pairing them with metrics that shape a narrative
    (storytelling metrics) about what you think is important
    + examples
      + customers who used our product both on desktop and mobile
      + % of the company who adopts a product once it’s available
- constraint cannot be decided by the planning process
  - constraint such as deadline cannot be decided in planning; the team will be
    in a deadlock where deciding amount of work to complete and deciding the
    deadline
- existing constraints before planning
  * cost of work we have already committed to (things committed last year or last
    sprint)
  * these constraints are the most important and it should be found out before
    planning
- top down planning comes with a risk
  * teams need to be willing to give feedback to higher management

##### project planning has an inflection point

- as the complexity of what you are trying to accomplish increases and Planning
  becomes more about coordination and communication, Project Planning is no
  longer appropriate to do at the company level
  * it is too fine grained
  * it leads you to make overly detailed commitments about how you solve
    a problem to people who are outside your team
    + once you have people outside your team monitoring your approach to solving
      a problem it becomes much harder to change your plan as you learn new
      things
- many organizations miss this critical inflection point and go sailing off into
  Strategic Planning with the expectations of Project Planning still firmly in
  place

##### do not wait to kill bad ideas

- instead emphasize with each team that you believe that their plans are
  hypotheses, and that you see their job as testing those hypotheses
  * setup regular conversations to ask how that testing process is going
    + what have they learned?
    + what have they disproven?
    + where have they changed their mind?
- so make it easier to kill bad ideas, and make it easy to talk about killing
  bad ideas sooner

##### minimize dependencies

- as the person designing Planning, encourage people to build their plans on the
  foundation of things that are already working and shipped
  * new capabilities (which introduces new dependencies), and building support
    and excitement for them should be done via Funding Proposals outside this
    process

##### headcount planning would not map to your plans

- shifting the high stakes nature of headcount planning by moving towards off
  cycle funding proposals

##### Environment with less restrictions on resources

- especially in a hyper-growth environment or when money and headcount are no
  object, you need to be better at planning, because the only constraints are
  the quality of your thinking

##### purposes of planning

- it acts as a point in time to synchronize our multi-threaded company
  * all year we operate with different teams and functions loosely coupled;
    having a moment in time when we all agree we want to collate as
    comprehensive a view of what we are doing as possible is an important
    investment to keep us from drifting too far apart
  * a time to all get on the same page before we all start running fast again
- it is a forcing function
  * we are all busy and sometimes things just don’t get done without a deadline
    and a person asking for them

### Recruitment

- the decision should not be based on intuition as even experienced interviewer
  could get it wrong; thus, a more objective methods should be used
  * quick intuition about a person is bad (a slow one is okay); 2-3 minutes get
    an impression (intuition) and the rest of the interview is about confirming
    the impression
  * find 6 exclusive metrics or characteristics that are important to the job
    + ask questions so that interviewer can grade the candidate for the
      6 metrics or characteristics
- writing things down is an important attribute/skill with higher management
  recruitments

### Meetings

- disclose agenda of a meeting such as the type of meeting
  * making a decision
  * sharing information
- share information after meeting to a wider audience so that people would not
  have anxiety in missing out a meeting which they may not be able to contribute
  to
- pre-reading
  * leave time for everyone to read the context so that no time is wasted during
    a meeting to find out context (either making sure people read beforehand or
    allocate time for people to read at the beginning of a meeting)
- check-in
  * ask people to start talking
- checkout
  * ask for one word participant think right after a meeting
    + to understand whether the meeting is a success or that is something
      missing
- dis-associate idea from the people who suggests it
  * list out the ideas without people's name

### Time management

- managers can start practising concentration periods of 20 minutes and continue
  to lengthen the time once getting used to the concentration period

### Delegation and time management

reference: [Delegation and Time Management - When being “helpful” is actually
hurting](https://skamille.medium.com/delegation-and-time-management-6cb326a880d3)

- managing middle managers
  * let them tell how they are thinking about tackling a problem or a situation
  * give a few bits of advice to them
  * they should only ask for direct intervention when their efforts have failed
- on controlling your time as a manager, making sure you do not take on too many
  tasks that are really the job of your subordinates
  * examples
    + one of your directs asks for your input on a complex decision, and you
      take ownership of studying the factors and making that decision
      + instead
        + talk over the decision in your 1–1, provide them with suggestions, but
          let them make the final call and justify it to the stakeholders
    + telling someone on your team that you want to review a proposal before
      they send it out
      + instead
        + review the doc in your 1–1 or another meeting specifically set up for
          this purpose (if they requested your review or if this is something
          they’re still learning how to do), but otherwise provide feedback at
          the same time that other stakeholders are given the doc
    + volunteering to provide the first draft of goals for a project that
      a member of your team owns
      + instead
        + let them set up the first draft of the goals, and again in the context
          of your 1–1 or a review set up for this purpose, review the goals that
          they have drafted and provide your feedback
  * most of the above meetings can be avoid by having the conversation during
    1-1
    * this frees up time for some other more important tasks
  * it puts the initiative squarely on the shoulders of your team, which is
    almost always where it belongs
    + they are not going to learn how to make good decisions, set good goals, or
      write effective docs
    + if you are always there providing a safety net or taking over the hard
      work from them
- instead of taking it over, ask them what they think the next steps should be;
  give your feedback, and let them bring the follow-ups to you in the next
  appropriate touch base

### Delegating worries

reference: [Worring](https://www.onebigfluke.com/2018/01/worrying.html)

- to manage junior engineers
  * delegate responsibilities, not tasks
    + they will learn a lot by pushing their own boundaries in the process
  * although not all responsbility are clear cut, we can start with some easier
    ones
    + examples
      + "reduce the number of user-visible HTTP 500s by 90%"
- if the delegation done correctly
  * finding and fixing bugs before anyone else notices
  * being pessimistic about the quality of our codebase and the stability of our
    infrastructure
  * identifying and mitigating risks in advance
  * strenthening relationships with more communications
- delegation
  * listening to teammates to figure out what needs to happen, instead of the
    other way around
  * ask teammates many questions to fully understand issues and their severity

### Alerting

A regular (usually every 2 weeks) alert review meeting to go over all the alerts.

- for critical alerts, discuss if it should stay critical
- for non-critical alerts, iterate the alerts and discuss what can be done to clear out
  * it can be tweaking the threshold or creating some automation

### Cost tracking

- monthly review meeting
  * not reviewed from a purely finance perspective
  * to understand if cost of an item sounds right

### One-on-ones

reference: [Dear Manager — How to make time for
1-on-1s](https://medium.com/absadesign/dear-manager-how-to-make-time-for-1-on-1s-f3831b2c77a3)

- reasons
  * to foster a healthy relationship between manager and direct report
    + human connection leads to trust
  * discuss things in private
  * mentoring, coaching and feedback
- scheduling
  * 30 minutes for each direct report
  * avoid Monday and Friday
  * morning is better in general; therr is less time for your day to spiral
  * avoid back-to-back slots
  * best to have direct reports fill in their preferred slot
  * arrange a face-to-face meeting if possible
  * once a schedule confirmed, protect the schedule and do not change
    + this shows respect and give direct reports a sense of their importance
- the conversation
  * it is important to talk about life in the first few minutes
    + be human
  * it is not a status update
  * personal growth can be discussed
  * to give feedback and get to know the direct report
  * be positive
  * take notes during the meeting

### Manager energy drain

reference: [Manager Energy
Drain](https://larahogan.me/blog/manager-energy-drain/)

- possible problems
  * working long hours to do hands-on “work-work” after full days of one-on-ones
  * the labour of managing or more strategic thinking drains their energy
    significantly faster than the work they did as engineer
  * context-switching between meetings super taxing

- solutions
  * calendar colour coding and defragging
    + colour code your calendar based on the kind of brain you use in each event
      + it helps to get a sense of in what ways the mental energy is being spent
    + use those colors to analyze how much context switching you are doing each
      day; also analyze how much you are drained at the end of the day when
      there is large blocks of the same brain
    + defrag or reorganize
      + move some things around so you are doing less context-switching, and see
        if that helps
      + or scatter the super draining events throughout the week to see if that
        makes it a little less taxing
  * delegate messy and unscoped projects
    + the best gift you can give your direct reports is a messy, unscoped
      project with a bit of a safety net; this kind of project creates the
      biggest opportunity for someone to grow as a leader
      + hones problem-solving abilities
      + forces them to lean on more people around them
      + stretches them far faster into new leadership skill sets than
        cleanly-packaged projects do
    + tell them how and in what medium you will support them
      + “DM me on Slack if you’ve spent more than 1 day stumped on how to move
        forward”
    + tell them that you expect this to be a stretch for them, and that is the
      point
      + you trust that they are capable of doing great work with this project,
        and that they will raise a flag to you if they get stuck; for less
        experienced direct reports, you might need to be more explicit about
        what “raise a flag” means
    + release yourself of being involved in the decision-making
    + [Project delegation
      template](https://wherewithall.com/resources/Project-Delegation-Template.pdf)
  * say no
    + it is possible that the best way to troubleshoot your energy drain is to
      reduce the amount of things you say “yes” to
      + and start to get more practice saying “no” or “I know I said yes before,
        but after more time thinking about it/doing it, I need to say no.”
    + write down draft emails you can copy and paste from to say “no” clearly
      and gracefully every time you need to and feel hesitation

### Culture

- it is not about free food, nice Christmas parties or other perks.
- it is about shared values and beliefs, the common ground of every discussion
  and the bigger reason why you are all working on the same idea
- the importance of culture heavily impacts your hiring; every single person you
  bring on in the early days changes your culture, in a good or bad way
- a leader is to facilitate discussions, offer a vision and set the guard rails;
  nothing defines culture more than actions

### Interview

- the better you are at convincing people to join your team and in selling your
  vision, the better they eventually work for you
- it is important to understand that it is not just about you interviewing
  a candidate
- design a hiring process that involves your team and gives the candidate a lot
  of opportunity to evaluate you as well

### Engineering lead, manager and product manager

- engineering lead
  * owns the story of "how"
- engineering manager
  * owns the story of "who"
    + coaching engineers' career paths and personal growth
    + recruiting and owning the team's interview workflow
    + delivering annual performance reviews
    + monitoring team health
- product manager
  * owns the story of "what"

### Incompetent leaders

- characteristics
  * moving away behaviours
    + create distance from others through hyper-emotionality, diminished
      communication, and skepticism that erodes trust
  * moving against behaviours
    + overpower and manipulate people while aggrandizing self
  * moving toward behaviours
    + being ingratiating, overly conforming, and reluctant to take chances or
      stand up for one's team
- absentee leaders are people in leadership roles who are psychologically absent
  from them
  * they were promoted into management, and enjoy the privileges and rewards of a
    leadership role, but avoid meaningful involvement with their teams
- reserach shows that being ignored by one's boss is more alienating than being
  treated poorly

### Build or buy?

Reference: [Why is it so hard to decide to
buy?](https://skamille.medium.com/why-is-it-so-hard-to-decide-to-buy-d86fee98e88e)

- reasons to build by default
  * over-focus on the edge cases that are not perfectly solved by off-the-shelf
    tools, and ignore the complexity of providing the main features in addition
    to the desired edge cases
  * our whole style of teaching computer science is first-principles based,
    which encourages the default to build ourselves
  * it is easy to see the bill for SaaS software (that has been bought) every
    month, and hard to appreciate that the engineering cost to build an internal
    version is still probably higher because you have not factored in the
    opportunity cost of having engineers build that system instead of
    contributing to more core business opportunities
  * when it comes time to evaluate people, we look at systems built from scratch
    and believe their authors show more technical talent than those who
    completed similarly-challenging integration projects with less raw code
- reasons to build
  * Is this software core to your business and its unique value? Will you need
    to change the product regularly to meet new business needs? Does it need to
    adapt to those changes quickly, on the order of days or (few) weeks, in
    order to keep up with the demands?
  * Are you in a space where a combination of scale and functionality means that
    you need bespoke software to run your business? Then yes, this is your core
    business
    + the trick here is going to be how much you should build
  * is this a place where you can build a small and very focused tool that would
    not need new features over time?
    + especially if most of the options are large and cumbersome to learn how to
      use
    + if this is a product area that needs to grow over time, you can find
      yourself trapped in a bind where you spend a lot of energy expanding your
      bespoke offering but migrating to a vendor tool is also an expensive
      proposition
- reasons to buy
  * if none of the above are true
    + do your best to find a SaaS solution
    + an open source or vendor solution
- what if there is no off-the-shelf solution that you can adopt but it does not
  fall into any of these other categories?
  * it is possible that you are solving a problem that may not need to be solved
- even when you decided to buy
  * it is ok to make the decision to build based on today’s offerings, if you
    feel confident that there is nothing out there that is close to your
    requirements; expecially for software that is not core to your business
    + try to build the minimal set so that you can migrate to better options if
      and when they appear
- what not to do when buying
  * buying a bigger solution than you need, and then feeling obligated to use
    all of it
    + JIRA might be the best example of this kind of abuse
    + you are writing a lot of code and maintaining a lot of bespoke logic for
      a system you do not really "own", which tends to bring a lot of technical
      debt over time as the product evolves in ways that are incompatible with
      your customizations
  * evaluating every option out there for every decision
    + there is a cost to delay of making a decision, so be realistic about what
      the really important factors are for choosing the product and try to
      otherwise move fast; when you agonize over every one of these decisions,
      you make the team less inclined to adopt something that they’re
      comfortable with and works and more inclined to just build their own thing
      to avoid the bureaucracy
  * over-vetting every product
    + if the process of approving a purchase is slow and painful, there is every
      incentive for engineers to just build so they do not have to wait for
      approvals to get started
  * underestimating the work of integration
    + integration is often the right choice in a cost-benefit analysis, but that
      does not make it free
    + no product is perfect and the more sales people there are around the
      product the more likely you are to find some unexpected gaps in the
      offering that you may have to work around, so make sure you understand the
      core important features
  * neglecting to speak to the value of what the engineers are providing when
    they are not building from scratch
    + these engineers need to feel like they are learning, and growing, and they
      deserve to be part of these decisions
      + the integrations, automation, the shims you build on top to make
        a unified surface area for the users at your company, the fine-tuning of
        the use of the software so you do not spend a ton of money, these are
        tasks for engineers
    + it is an ongoing process to explain to engineers who are not familiar with
      working on these problems why they are still interesting and fun even when
      you are not building everything from scratch
    + you will need to look at your rewards structure if you want to encourage
      a move towards buying more and building less

### Bullshit detection

Reference: [Introductory bullshit detection for non-technical
managers](https://itsyourturnblog.com/introductory-bullshit-detection-for-non-technical-managers-7c7a9e54afee)

- having a rough idea of how it works from the direct report is not good enough
  * it is better to understand how it works
- What problem are you actually trying to solve?
  * no metaphors
  * describe it from the point of view of the person or group encountering the
    problem
  * unless you have a satisfactory answer to this question, you do not move on
    with any project, no matter how small it seems
- What is one concrete example of a problem this will solve?
  * a trap a lot of technical people can fall into is wanting to create
    something simply because it is interesting, not because it is actually
    useful in any way
  * if you do not have a satisfactory answer to even one problem that could be
    practically solved, then it is at best considered research
- Who specifically will represent the users of this system?
  * this can be a problem with a product idea as well
  * a real life individual person they will consult with on questions and who
    can verify it meets their expectations, at least
  * if your team is working in a vacuum, it is a sure sign they’re working on
    the wrong thing
- What are the platform constraints?
  * get answers that are as specific and thorough as possible
  * create the list because you have to make sure it all gets tested
- What are the memory constraints?
  * you should at least expect to have an answer to how much memory will be
    needed
- What are the performance constraints?
  * there is an acceptable upper bound and you need to have absolute clarity on
    what that is
- "I’m making a generic version of ..."
  * It means: I don’t understand the constraints of the actual problem, so I’m
    going to design an even bigger problem that we have no way of verifying the
    efficacy of.
- "I'm creating a new framework to ..."
  * It means: I’m not interested in solving the actual problem, so I’m going to
    create something else so that the person that actually will solve the
    problem has to also fix the problems in my stuff on top of that.
- "It's platform independent."
  * It means: I literally have not spent two seconds thinking about what
    platforms this will obviously not work for.
- "I'm adding this to make sure it's future-proof."
  * It means: I believe in fairies.
- "I really need to refactor this bit ..."
  * However, it can also be just an excuse to change things to some conception
    of “better” for no real benefit.
  * Unless you’re Google, in which case you keep doing that until some other
    team solves the actual problem and your project gets deprecated.
- 80/50 rule
  * If you’re not 80% done by the time you’ve used 50% of your resources, you
    are behind.
  * When something doesn’t pass this test, it’s time to evaluate what needs to
    change. Does this project need to stop? Do other projects need to move? “I
    can make up the time” is not a realistic response.

### Giving feedback in remote teams

Reference: [The importance of small, positive interactions - How to give regular
positive feedback in
remotely](https://leaddev.com/culture/importance-small-positive-interactions)

- to make a remote team feel engaged and not just transactional, giving regular,
  intentional praise is essential
- with all the public researches available, it indicates more positive
  interactions than negative ones is essential to a healthy and trusting
  relationship
  * negative feedback should be "occasional" in normal circumstances
- writing thoughtfully-crafted messages
- scheduling more meetings to check in on people
- take time in 1:1s to talk about things other than work, to check in on them as
  people, and to share some of your own life

### Managing unexpected work requests

Reference: [Managing unexpected work requests when your team is
busy](https://leaddev.com/management/managing-unexpected-work-requests-when-your-team-busy)

- ask where this request falls in the priority of everything your team is doing
  * tell the requester all of the things your team is doing at the moment, and
    ask them which things are okay to slow down or stop doing in order to
    fulfill the new task
    + this allows you to clarify the impact of the disruption to the team so
      that together you can decide whether the new request is important enough
      to switch to
    + track these disruptions to make a case for future discussions
  * avoid using this tactic to much as others might feel you are playing on
    bureaucracy; use it when your team is really busy
- use the request as evidence to bolster support for other unscheduled projects
  * use the request to prioritize work of "important but not urgent"
    + for example, automation or monitoring
