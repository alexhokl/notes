# Concepts

## Functionalities

- hiding IP address of client
  * this can be checked by
    + `curl -4 l2.io/ip`
- hidling IPv6 address
  * An IPv6 leak occurs when a VPN app successfully intercepts your IPv4
    connection and routes it through the VPN server but doesnâ€™t account for
    potential IPv6 connections. It therefore allows connections over IPv6,
    exposing the real IPv6 addresses of anyone using an ISP that supports IPv6
    to IPv6-capable websites.
  * this can be checked by
    + `curl -4 icanhazip.com`
    + `curl -6 icanhazip.com`
- hiding DNS queries
  * this can be checked by [dnsleaktest.com](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/)
  * note that configuring DNS server to use `1.1.1.1` (Cloudflare) or similar
    does not hide DNS queries
  * if VPN is not being used, encrypted DNS service can be used to hide DNS
    queries
- hiding IP address in WebRTC traffic
  * this can be checked by [browserleaks.com](https://browserleaks.com/webrtc)
