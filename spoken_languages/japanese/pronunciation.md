## 音読み and 訓読み

- 音読み (おんよみ) - Chinese reading
- 訓読み (くんよみ) - Japanese reading
- Japan had their own language, and while it is not the same as Japanese today,
  it was not Chinese either
  * Japan had their own words for things like water, fire, food, and all the
    other stuff that exists in life.
  * instead of converting the Japanese language into Chinese, they decided each
    kanji will have a Chinese way of reading it and a Japanese way of reading it
  * the Chinese language has far more sounds than the Japanese language does
  * as well as Japan's lack of tones, this is the reason onyomi is similar to
    Chinese but not exactly the same as the originals
- in a dictionary, onyomi is written in katakana and kunyomi is written in
  hiragana
- there are also kanji characters that only have kunyomi readings because they
  are kanji created in Japan
  * 国字 (こくじ)
    + This means Japanese elite/scholars/priests took pieces of kanji characters
      and put them together to create a new kanji, for a concept that was native
      to Japan.
- multiple onyomi readings for a single kanji
  * imported from China at different times
  * usually similar meaning using the same reading (sound)
  * examples of 下
    + げ
      + 下品 (げひん)
    + か
      + 地下 (ちか)
  * imported from 3 major periods
    + 呉
    + 漢
    + 唐
- general rules
  * onyomi compounds
    + a two-kanji (or more) compound usually takes the onyomi readings
    + called jukugo 熟語 (じゅくご)
    + There are no hanging-on hiragana (okurigana) sticking out from the word
  * single kanji kunyomi
    + most words that consist of a single kanji, sitting all alone with no
      okurigana, are read with the kunyomi reading
  * single kanji onyomi
    + this is especially true for kanji numbers
  * kunyomi with okurigana
    + if a kanji has hiragana attached to it, it almost always uses the kunyomi
      reading
      + the kana suffixes are called okurigana 送り仮名 (おくがな)
  * exceptions
    + words that contain kanji that have both on'yomi and kunyomi readings
    + kanji that get assigned to katakana words
- strategy to learn
  * just learn one reading per kanji
  * choose the "best" kanji reading to learn
  * learn other readings through vocabulary

## 連濁 (Rendaku)

- aka "sequential voicing"
- when two or more words join together to form one word, and the initial
  consonant of the second word becomes voiced
- un-related facts
  * `k`, `s`, `t`, `h` are unvoiced consonants
  * `g`, `z`, `d`, `b`, `p`, `m`, `r` are voiced consonants
  * ` ゛` is 濁点 (だくてん)
  * ` ゜` is 半濁点 (はんだくてん)
  * compound word
    + both words exist on their own separately, but when they come together they
      create a new, unique word
- rendaku conversion
  * `k` => `g`
  * `s` => `z`
  * `t` => `d`
  * `h` => `b` or `p`
- examples
  * 手 (て) + 紙 (かみ) = 手紙 (てがみ)
  * 人 (ひと) + 人 (ひと) = 人々 (ひとびと)
  * 青 (あお) + 空 (そら) = 青空 (あおぞら)
  * 平 (ひら) + 仮名 (かな) = 平仮名 (ひらがな)
  * 山 (やま) + 桜 (さくら) = 山桜 (やまざくら)
  * 鼻 (はな) + 血 (ち) = 鼻血 (はなぢ)
  * 花 (はな) + 火 (ひ) = 花火 (はなび)
- basic necessary conditions
  * two words come together to form a compound word
  * the first consonant of the second word is unvoiced
  * the first consonant of the second word is one of the four sets of characters
    that can change into a voiced consonant with dakuten or handakuten (`k`,
    `s`, `t`, or `h`)
  * surrounding the first consonant of the second word are voiced vowels (and
    sometimes nasals)
- if the first word ends in つ or ん the `h` consonant will usually rendaku to
  `p`; otherwise, `b`
  * `つ` will be converted to small `っ` as well
  * examples
    * 鉛 (えん) + 筆 (ひつ) = 鉛筆 (えんぴつ)
    * 出 (しゅつ) + 発 (はつ) = 出発 (しゅっぱつ)
- general guidelines
  * 和語 (大和言葉) wago words do rendaku
    + it almost never start with a dakuten or handakuten voiced consonant
  * 漢語 (かんご) loanwords do not rendaku
    + stopping rendaku even when they are in a compound with a wago word
  * 外来語 (がいらいご) loanwords do not rendaku
    + exceptions are mostly imported words from Dutch and Portuguese during the
      Edo period
      + it is trickier to spot as they usually appear in kanji or katakana
    + exceptions: gairago + wago can cause rendaku, just like a normal wago
      compound
  * if the second word in the compound has a voiced consonant or handakuon
    anywhere in it, rendaku does not occur
  * if voicing in the first word is too close to the second word, rendaku may
    not occur
    + dakuten and handakuten are too close to each other
    + examples
      + 赤 (あか) + 玉 (たま) = 赤玉 (あかだま)
      + 水 (みず) + 玉 (たま) = 水玉 (みずたま)
    + there are a lot of exceptions to this rule; it is like a 50/50 chance
  * in words that come together to mean "X and Y," rendaku does not occur
    + 山 (やま) + 川 (かわ) = 山川 (やまかわ) - mountains and rivers
    + 山 (やま) + 川 (かわ) = 山川 (やまがわ) - a mountain river
  * repeating onomatopoeia do not rendaku
  * certain prefixes and suffixes cause rendaku not to occur
    + examples
      + 半 (はん) Half
      + 御 (お, み) Honorific
      + 毎 (まい) Every
      + 一 (ひと) One
      + 二 (ふた) Two
      + 片 (かた) One-sided
      + 唐 (から) China
      + 白 (しろ) White
      + 黒 (くろ) Black
      + 先 (さき) Previous, Tip
      + 紐 (ひも) String, Cord
      + 浜 (はま) Beach
      + 姫 (ひめ) Princess
      + 煙 (けむり) Smoke
      + 土 (つち) Dirt
      + 潮 (しお) Tide
      + 血 (けつ) Blood
      + 下 (した) Below
- revese rendaku
  * two voiced consonants do not exist in a row
  * examples
    + 舌 (した) + 鼓 (つづみ) = 舌鼓 (したづつみ)
    + 腹 (はら) + 鼓 (つづみ) = 腹鼓 (はらづつみ)
    + 後 (あと) + 退ざり (しざり) = 後退さり (あとじさり)
- words with very high chance of rendaku
  * 花 (はな)
  * 風呂 (ふろ)
  * 骨 (ほね)
  * 笛 (ふえ)
  * 箱 (はこ)

## さん

- it depends of the pitch of the sound of the word that comes before it
  * if the word before さん ends in a high pitch, さん is pronounced as `san`
  * if the word before さん ends in a low pitch, さん is pronounced as `zan`

## 何

- readinngs
  * なん
    + followed by sounds starting with `d`, `t`, or `n`
      + 何ですか。
      + 何で。
      + 何と...
      + 何の...
    + asking how many with counters
      + 何歳
      + 何人
      + 何時
    + set expressions
      + これは何だ。
      + 何だろう
