### Difference between _index.md and index.md

- `_index.md`
  * This file is used to define the content for section or list pages. It serves
    as a container for content that represents a collection of pages, such as
    posts in a blog or items in a section. This file can include front matter
    and markdown content, which can be rendered when Hugo builds the site.

- `index.md`
  * It is used to create a leaf bundle, which represents a single page.
  * The content of this file is treated independently, and it does not serve to
    aggregate or list other pages.
