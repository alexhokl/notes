# Types of metrics

- [cAdvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor) - container metrics such as
  CPU, memory, memory and disk of a cluster exposed by kubetlet
- [node-exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) - node metrics

# Abstractions of Metrics

### Four Golden Signals

This is originated from [Google SRE Handbook](https://landing.google.com/sre/books/).

- Latency — The time it takes to service a request
- Traffic — A measure of how much demand is being placed on your system
- Errors — The rate of requests that fail
- Saturation — How “full” your service is.

### USE Method

This focuses on resources (all physical server functional components (CPUs,
disks, buses, ...)).

- Utilisation: the average time that the resource was busy servicing work
- Saturation: the degree to which the resource has extra work which it cannot
  service, often queued
- Errors: the count of error events

### RED Method

This focuses on services.

- Rate: The number of requests per second.
- Errors: The number of those requests that are failing.
- Duration: The amount of time those requests take.

# Metric sources

## Node Exporter

- [Available metrics (via unit test of node-exporter)](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/blob/master/collector/fixtures/e2e-output.txt)

Metric | Description
--- | ---
node_memory_MemTotal_bytes | the total amount of physical RAM (not including SWAP space)
node_memory_MemFree_bytes | the amount of physical RAM, in kilobytes, left unused by the system
node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes | An estimate of how much memory is available for starting new applications, without swapping. Calculated from MemFree, SReclaimable, the size of the file LRU lists, and the low watermarks in each zone. The estimate takes into account that the system needs some page cache to function well, and that not all reclaimable slab will be reclaimable, due to items being in use. The impact of those factors will vary from system to system.
node_vmstat_oom_kill | OOMKill count
node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="user"} | CPU time spent in userland
node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="system"} | CPU time spent in the kernel
node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="iowait"} | CPU time waiting for I/O
node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"} | CPU time had nothing to do
node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="irq"} | CPU time servicing interrupts
node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="softirq"} | CPU time servicing soft interrupts
node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="guest"} | CPU time spent on running VMs (assuming the CPU in question itself is a host running VMs)
node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="steal"} | CPU time stole by other VMs (assuming the CPU in question itself is a VM)
node_load15 | 15-minute load average - number of processes to be processed in the last 15 minutes - it is best to divide this number by average number of CPUs available at the time

- [GitLab - Saturation
  Metrics](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/blob/master/rules/service_saturation.yml)

### Concepts

#### Data types

- instant vector
  - a set of time series containing a single sample for each time series, all
    sharing the same timestamp
- range vector
  - a set of time series containing a range of data points over time for each
    time series
  - Range vector literals select a range of samples back from the current
    instant.
    - example: `http_requests_total{job="prometheus"}[5m]`
- scalar
  - a simple numeric floating point value
- string

#### Metric types

- gauge
- counter
- histogram
- summary
  - similar to a histogram, except that you will need to specify which quantiles
    instead of buckets
  - while histograms can be aggregated, it is not statistically valid for
    summary quantiles

#### label matching operators

- `=`
- `!=`
- `=~`
  - select labels that regex-match the provided string
  - use `{job=~".+"}` instead of `{job=~".*"}` to avoid empty labels
- `!~`
  - select labels that do not regex-match the provided string

#### Functions

- `rate`
  - the rate of increase per second, averaged over the entire provided time
    window
  - it takes into account all of the data points within the range
  - it automatically adjusts for resets
    - thus, it is suitable for a counter but not for a gauge
  - it must be applied before any other aggregation functions such as `sum`
  - it is suited only for spotting trends, spikes, and for alerting
    - extrapolation will be applied if there are no data points fit exact at the
      start or the end of the window. Since the fitting is unlikely,
      extrapolation almost always happens and thus the decimal points be seen in
      rate values (see diagram in reference below)
      - extrapolation is done using the first and last data points and assuming
        the data points are not too far from the ends of the window
  - at least 2 samples are need in the window for the metric to show up
  - example
    - suppose it scrapes for every 10 seconds and the following 5 samples are
      retrieved
      - `0`, `4`, `6`, `10`, `2`
      - the rate is `(12-0)/60=0.2`
  - references
    - [How Exactly Does PromQL Calculate
      Rates?](https://promlabs.com/blog/2021/01/29/how-exactly-does-promql-calculate-rates)
- `irate`
  - it takes into account only the last 2 data point within the range
    - no extrapolation will be applied
  - it automatically adjusts for resets
  - it offers faster rendering but more spiky than `rate`
  - at least 2 samples are need in the window for the metric to show up
- `increase`
  - `incrase(foo[5m]) / (5*60)` equivalent to `rate(foo[5m])`
  - at least 2 samples are need in the window for the metric to show up
  - extrapolation will be applied if necessary (with condition same as `rate`)
- `histogram_quantile`
  - examples of 95-percentile
    - `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(your_histogram_bucket[5m])) by (le))`
    - `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(your_histogram_bucket[5m])) by (le, your-category))`
    - `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(your_histogram_bucket{job="Worker"}[$__rate_interval])) by(le))`
  - assuming the name of histogram metric is `your_histogram`
    - `your_histogram_bucket` counts the number of data points fall within the
      range of the bucket
    - `your_histogram_count` counts the total number of data points in all
      buckets
    - `your_histogram_sum` sums up the value of all data point in all buckets

### Tips

- always apply `rate` to counter metrics

- [Prometheus data
  source](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/prometheus/) -
  configurations available on Grafana

### Settings

- `Min step`
  - the lower bounds on the interval between data points
    - once this is set, variable `$__interval` or `$__rate_interval` can be
      used
- `Resolution`
  - it is default to `1/1`
    - `1/2` (or lower) can be used for faster rendering
    - `1/2` means 1 data point per 2 pixels; `1/10` means 1 data point per 10
      pixels

### Variables

- `$__rate_interval`
  - `max($__interval + Scrape interval, 4 * Scrape interval)`
    - where scrape interval is scrape interval of the metric if `Min step` is
      not set

## Kubernetes

- if memory limits are implemented correctly, a node should never go into
  paging (or swap space). `node_exporter` metrics `node_vmstat_pgpgin` and
  `node_vmstat_pgpgin` can be used to indicate such activities.
- The “container” metrics that are exposed from `cAdvisor` are ultimately the
  metrics reported by the underlying Linux `cgroup` implementation.
- CPU limit and request are specified as fractions of a CPU or core (down to
  1/1000th) and those of memory is specified in bytes. If you set only limits,
  the request will be the same as the limit. Limits give you one knob to
  over-provision containers on a node as limits are not accounted for by the
  Kubernetes scheduler. That being said, if your container exceeds your limits
  the action depends on the resource; you will be throttled if you exceed the
  CPU limit, and killed if you exceed the memory limit.

## Operations

### To deploy Prometheus Operator

```sh
git clone https://github.com/coreos/kube-prometheus
cd kube-prometheus
```

There is a problem with release `0.3` (and probably since `0.2`) where
`nodeSelector` does not work. To workaround this problem, remove any
`nodeSelector` in all files in `/manifest` directory.

There is a problem with `kubelet` setup on AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) and it
is likely related to [this issue](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/1087).
The workaround is to replace all `https` and `https-metrics` to `http` and
`http-metrics` respectively in
`manifests/prometheus-serviceMonitorKubelet.yaml`.

On AKS, metrics of `coredns` do not get exposed via a service. To make it work
with `ServiceMonitor` `coredns`, we need to modify `ports` section of service
`kube-dns` in namespace `kube-system`
([ref](https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/issues/936#issuecomment-521162563)).

```yaml
  ports:
  - name: dns
    port: 53
    protocol: UDP
    targetPort: 53
  - name: dns-tcp
    port: 53
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 53
  - name: metrics
    port: 9153
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 9153
```

Note: There is a chance that we can add an extra `PodMonitor` instead of
modifying the above service. But it is not done at the time of writing.

On AKS, containers are unable to talk to Kubernetes API via subnet '172.x.x.x'
([ref](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/552)).  As a result we need to add
the following to `endpoints` configuration in
`manifests/prometheus-serviceMonitorApiserver.yaml` (note that it is not
`metricRelabelings`).

```yaml
    relabelings:
    - action: keep
      regex: default;kubernetes;https
      sourceLabels:
      - __meta_kubernetes_namespace
      - __meta_kubernetes_service_name
      - __meta_kubernetes_endpoint_port_name
    - replacement: kubernetes.default.svc:443
      targetLabel: __address__
```

To add `thanos` support, create file `thanos-azure.yaml` with configuration of
Azure Blob Storage (see
[Object Storage - Azure](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/blob/master/docs/storage.md#azure))
and it should be similar to the following.

```yaml
type: AZURE
config:
  storage_account: your-storage-account-name-short
  storage_account_key: "your-storage-account-access-key"
  container: thanos
  max_retries: 0
```

Note: make sure the storage account and the corresponding container has been
created.

Then, apply the file as a secret
`kubectl -n monitoring create secret generic thanos-objstore-config --from-file=thanos.yaml=./thanos-azure.yaml`.
([ref](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/blob/master/Documentation/thanos.md))

Add the following to `manifests/prometheus-prometheus.yaml`.

```yaml
  thanos:
    version: v0.10.0
    objectStorageConfig:
      key: thanos.yaml
      name: thanos-objstore-config
  storage:
    volumeClaimTemplate:
      spec:
        storageClassName: managed-premium
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 40Gi
```

```sh
kubectl create -f manifest/setup/
```

Wait for a while for the operator to be deployed.

```sh
kubectl create -f manifest/
```

Since `kube-scheduler` and `kube-controller-manager` are not visible to users
on public cloud ([ref](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/issues/2437)),
the corresponding service monitors can be deleted.

```sh
kubectl delete servicemonitor kube-scheduler kube-controller-manager
```

To add [Thanos Query](https://thanos.io/components/query.md/) and
[Thanos Store](https://thanos.io/components/store.md/).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/thanos-io/kube-thanos
cd kube-thanos
```

In directory `manifest`, replace all namespace of `thanos` with `monitoring`.

In `manifests/thanos-query-deployment.yaml`, replace `--store` URL with
`thanos-store.monitoring.svc:10901`.

In `manifests/thanos-store-statefulSet.yaml`, remove flag
`--experimental.enable-index-header` and replace secret name with
`thanos-objstore-config`.

```sh
kubectl create -f manifest/
```

![thanos architecture](./images/thanos-deployment.jpg)

To add [Prometheus Pushgateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway)
and its `serviceMonitor`.

```sh
helm install --name prometheus-pushgateway -f prometheus-pushgateway-values.yml --namespace monitoring stable/prometheus-pushgateway
```

In Grafana, add `thanos` as a data source with URL
`http://thanos-query.monitoring.svc:9090`.
