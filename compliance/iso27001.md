## Documents required

### Mandatory

- ISMS Scope Document
  * Defines the boundaries and applicability of the Information Security
    Management System (ISMS)
- Information Security Policy
  * Outlines the organization's overall approach to information security,
    including objectives and responsibilities
- Risk Assessment Report
  * Details the identification, evaluation, and treatment of information
    security risks
- Statement of Applicability (SoA)
  * Justifies the selection or exclusion of controls from Annex A, ensuring
    alignment with the organization's risk profile
- Risk Treatment Plan
  * Describes how identified risks will be managed and mitigated
- Information Security Objectives
  * Lists specific goals related to information security that the organization
    aims to achieve
- Internal Audit Report
  * Documents findings from internal audits conducted to assess compliance and
    effectiveness of the ISMS
- Evidence of Competence
  * Demonstrates that personnel involved in the ISMS have the necessary skills
    and knowledge
- Security Awareness Training Program Results
  * Shows evidence of training provided to employees regarding information
    security practices
- Monitoring and Measurement Results
  * Includes evidence on how information security performance is monitored and
    measured
- Documented Internal Audit Process
  * Outlines how internal audits are conducted within the organization
- Management Review Results
  * Evidence from management reviews assessing the ISMS's performance and areas
    for improvement
- Non-Conformities and Remediation Evidence

    address them

## Certification

- a two-stage audit process from a certification body
  * stage 1: readiness review
  * stage 2: full audit
- for 3 years with annual surveillance audits
- it generally takes longer than SOC 2 due to the extensive requirements for
  documentation and control implementation (and SOC 2 requirements are more
  specific)
- in terms of non-conformities, the report is less specific than SOC 2
- 90% overlap with SOC 2
