## Libraries

- [flutter_animate](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_animate)

## Files

- `analysis_options.yaml`
  * linter options

## Commands

### Setup

##### To upgrade flutter installation

```sh
flutter upgrade
```

##### To check flutter installation

```sh
flutter doctor
```

In case there are problems with CocoaPods, there is a chance that the machine
does not have the correct version of Ruby installed yet. In case `rbenv` is used
run `rbenv init` to ensure the version comes from `rbenv` is being used.

##### To list available emulators

```sh
flutter emulators
```

##### To start an emulator

```sh
flutter emulators --launch Pixel_3_API_28
```

##### To list connected devices

```sh
flutter devices
```

##### To disable web as connected device

```sh
flutter config --no-enable-web
```

##### To create an application

```sh
flutter create your_app_name
```

This also creates directory `your_app_name` but it does not include `git`
integration.

To create an application in an existing directory

```sh
flutter create --project-name an_underscore_package_name .
```

##### To debug on an Android device

1. Search for "build number" in settings
2. Tap on it 7 times
3. Search for "developer options" in settings
4. Enable "USB debugging"
5. Connect the device to the computer via USB
6. Run `flutter devices` to see the device
7. Run `flutter run -d device_name` to run the application on the device


Note that step `1` and `2` should be one-off setting.

### Packges

##### To add a package

```sh
flutter pub add flutter_animate
```

This adds package `flutter_animate` to section `dependencies` in `pubspec.yaml`.

##### To download dependencies (packages)

```sh
flutter pub get
```

### Build and run

##### To run on either emulator or connected device

```sh
flutter run
```

##### To run on a specific device

```sh
flutter run -d macos
```

##### To build the assets directory

```sh
flutter build bundle
```

##### To build an ahead-of-time compiled snapshot

```sh
flutter build aot
```

##### To build an Android APK file

```sh
flutter build apk
```

##### To build an Android App Bundle file

```sh
flutter build appbundle
```

##### To build an iOS application bundle

```sh
flutter build ios
```

## Widgets

### SteamBuilder<T>

* [reference](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StreamBuilder-class.html)
* it builds itself based on the latest snapshot of interaction with a `Stream`
  + via `State.setState`
  + rebuilding is decoupled from the timing of the stream (as per timing of
    `yield` is being invoked

### Expanded

* [reference](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Expanded-class.html)
* it must be a decendent of a `Row`, `Column` or `Flex`
* the path to it must contain only `StatelessWidget` or `StatefulWidget` (and
  not like `RenderObjectWidget`)

### Adaptive layout

Reference: [tomcheung/flutter_adaptive_gallery](https://github.com/tomcheung/flutter_adaptive_gallery/tree/finish)

A widget can be created to abstract layout sizes to a limited set of values.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

enum LayoutSizeData { large, medium, small }

class AdaptiveLayoutBuilder extends StatelessWidget {
  final Widget Function(LayoutSizeData) layoutBuilder;

  const AdaptiveLayoutBuilder({
    super.key,
    required this.layoutBuilder,
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final width = MediaQuery.sizeOf(context).width;

    LayoutSizeData size = switch (width) {
      >= 800 => LayoutSizeData.large,
      >= 600 => LayoutSizeData.medium,
      _ => LayoutSizeData.small
    };

    return layoutBuilder(size);
  }
}

class LayoutSize extends InheritedWidget {
  final LayoutSizeData size;

  const LayoutSize({super.key, required this.size, required super.child});

  @override
  bool updateShouldNotify(covariant LayoutSize oldWidget) {
    return oldWidget.size != size;
  }

  static LayoutSizeData of(BuildContext context) {
    return context.dependOnInheritedWidgetOfExactType<LayoutSize>()!.size;
  }
}
```

In the code deciding the layout, the conceptual size can be retrieved via build
context.

```dart
final size = LayoutSize.of(context);
```

Note that this is usually invoked in `build` method and care should be taken to
avoid triggering too many re-draws.

## Concepts

- builder as a delegate to make rendering more efficient

## State management

### Riverpod

- types of provider
  * Provider
  * FutureProvider
  * StreamProvider
- Family
  * it works like a factory method where different parameter produces different
    providers
  * for custom provider classes, equality operator must be implemented; `Family`
    will keep creating invalid instances of providers, otherwise
- AutoDispose
  * it automatically disposes the provider when it is no longer used; such as
    showing different screens
  * this is not the default behaviour
- all proivders are declared as singletons and global
- it caches values by default
  * the caching is pretty greedy; thus, invalidation logic is likely required
