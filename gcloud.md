## gcloud Commands

### Basics

##### To check command installation

```sh
gcloud info
```

##### To login

```sh
gcloud auth login
```

##### To create ADC with user account

```sh
gcloud auth application-default login
```

Note that it is likely the user has to be assigned with role
`roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer` and the following to associate the
credentials with a project (which can be billed against)

```sh
gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project your_project_name
```

##### To impersonate a service account

```sh
gcloud auth application-default login --impersonate-service-account your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

##### To list existing logins

```sh
gcloud auth list
```

##### To echo out JWT token of the current login

```sh
gcloud auth print-identity-token
```

##### To list current configuration

```sh
gcloud config list
```

##### To set default zone

```sh
gcloud config set compute/zone asia-east1-b
```

##### To change project

```sh
gcloud config set core/project $PROJECT_ID
```

##### To get project number from project ID

```sh
gcloud projects list --filter="project_id:$PROJECT_ID" --format='value(project_number)'
```

##### To get project ID from project number

```sh
gcloud projects list --filter="project_id:$PROJECT_NUMBER" --format='value(project_id)'
```

### Kubernetes

##### To create a kubernetes cluster

```sh
gcloud container clusters create $CLUSTER_NAME -m n1-standard-2 --num-nodes=3
```

##### To enable network policy (Calico)

```sh
gcloud container clusters update $CLUSTER_NAME --update-addons=NetworkPolicy=ENABLED
gcloud container clusters update $CLUSTER_NAME --enable-network-policy
```

##### To enable workload identity

```sh
gcloud container clusters update $CLUSTER_NAME --workload-pool=$PROJECT_ID.svc.id.goog
gcloud container node-pools update $POOL_NAME --cluster $CLUSTER_NAME --workload-metadata=GKE_METADATA
```

Note that this change will prevent workloads from using the Compute Engine
service account and must be carefully rolled out.

See [Link Kubernetes service account to Google service account](./#link-kubernetes-service-account-to-google-service-account).

##### To set credentials on local machine to access Kubernetes clusters

```sh
gcloud container clusters get-credentials $CLUSTER_NAME
```

To connect with a private IP address

```sh
gcloud container clusters get-credentials $CLUSTER_NAME --internal-ip
```

##### To authenticate to Container Registry on GCP

```sh
gcloud auth configure-docker
```

Note that it can be executed on a GCP compute instance as well

##### To show cluster information

```sh
gcloud container clusters describe $CLUSTER_NAME
```

##### To list clusters

```sh
gcloud container clusters list
```

or, to restrict to a zone

```sh
gcloud container clusters list --zone asia-east1-b
```

##### To delete a container cluster

```sh
gcloud container clusters delete any-project-name-cluster
```

##### To change the number of nodes in a cluster

```sh
gcloud container clusters resize $CLUSTER_NAME --size=1
```

##### To migrate workloads to a different machine type

```sh
gcloud container node-pools create new-pool-name \
  --cluster $CLUSTER_NAME \
  --machine-type=f1-micro \
  --num-nodes=10

for node in $(kubectl get nodes -l cloud.google.com/gke-nodepool=default-pool -o=name); do kubectl cordon "$node"; done

for node in $(kubectl get nodes -l cloud.google.com/gke-nodepool=default-pool -o=name); do kubectl drain --force --ignore-daemonsets "$node"; done

gcloud container node-pools delete default-pool --cluster $CLUSTER_NAME
```

A kubernetes service can be exposed externally by assigning it as type `LoadBalancer` (see [Connect a Front End to a Back End Using a Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/connecting-frontend-backend/))

##### To tag and push images onto Google Container Registry

```sh
docker tag image-name:latest asia.gcr.io/project-name/image-name
gcloud docker push asia.gcr.io/project-name/image-name
```

##### To allow pulling docker images from another project

Suppose the image in docker registry of `your-project-a` is used in cluster of
`your-project-b`,

```sh
gcloud config set core/project your-project-b
SVC_EMAIL=$(gcloud iam service-accounts list --filter="Compute Engine default service account" --format=json | jq -r '.[] | .email')
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding your-project-a --member=serviceAccount:${SVC_EMAIL} --role roles/storage.objectViewer
```

##### To allow push docker image

The following roles and permissions are required

- `roles/storage.objectCreator`
- `storage.buckets.get` (a permission)

##### To create roles for Helm 2

```sh
kubectl --user=admin/$CLUSTER_NAME create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole cluster-admin --user $(gc config get-value account)
kubectl create serviceaccount --namespace=kube-system tiller
kubectl create clusterrolebinding tiller-clusterrolebinding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:tiller
helm init --service-account tiller --wait
```

##### To create a public IP address and assign it to a cluster running Ingress using Nginx

Assuming the region of the cluster is `asia-east1`,

```sh
gcloud compute addresses create my-cluster-ip --region asia-east1
IPADDR=$(gcloud compute addresses describe my-cluster-ip --region asia-east1 --format json | jq -r .address)
helm install nginx-ingress --namespace default stable/nginx-ingress --set controller.service.loadBalancerIP=$IPADDR
```

##### Link Kubernetes service account to Google service account

Note that [workload identity has to be enabled](./#to-enable-workload-identity)
before accounts can be linked.

```sh
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
  --role roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser \
  --member "serviceAccount:$PROJECT_ID.svc.id.goog[$NAMESPACE/$SERVICE_ACCOUNT]" \
  $GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

To the Kubernetes service account to bind to, add the following annotation

```yaml
iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account=your_google_service_accont_name@your_project_id.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

To create a secret and allow a Google service account to access it,

```sh
gcloud secrets create $SECRET_NAME --replication-policy=automatic --data-file=$SECRET_FILE
gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding $SECRET_NAME \
  --member=serviceAccount:$GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --role=roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor
```

To synchronise a secret from GCP Secret Manager to file system of a container,

```yaml
apiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: SecretProviderClass
metadata:
  name: your-app-secrets
spec:
  provider: gcp
  parameters:
    secrets: |
      - resourceName: "projects/$PROJECT_ID/secrets/testsecret/versions/latest"
        fileName: "secret.txt"
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: $SERVICE_ACCOUNT
  namespace: $NAMESPACE
  annotations:
    iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account: $GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
  namespace: default
spec:
  serviceAccountName: $SERVICE_ACCOUNT
  containers:
  - image: your-image:latest
    name: mypod
    volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: "/var/secrets"
        name: mysecret
  volumes:
  - name: mysecret
    csi:
      driver: secrets-store.csi.k8s.io
      readOnly: true
      volumeAttributes:
        secretProviderClass: your-app-secrets
```

##### Unlink Kubernetes service account to Google service account

```sh
gcloud iam service-accounts remove-iam-policy-binding \
  --role roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser \
  --member "serviceAccount:$PROJECT_ID.svc.id.goog[$NAMESPACE/$SERVICE_ACCOUNT]" \
  $GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com

### Cloud SQL

#### SQL Server

##### BAK export

To enable command `gcloud beta sql export bak` to upload to a bucket, service
account running the SQL server requires permission to write to the bucket.

To find the service account,

```sh
gcloud sql instances list --project $project_id --format json \
  | jq -r '.[] | .name + "," + .serviceAccountEmailAddress'
```

To grant the write permission,

```sh
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs://$BUCKET_NAME \
  --role=roles/storage.admin \
  --member=serviceAccount:$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
```

##### BAK import

To enable command `gcloud beta sql import bak` to upload to a bucket, service
account running the SQL server requires permission to read from the bucket. Note
that cross-project import is possible as long as IAM permissions has been
configured correctly.

To find the service account,

```sh
gcloud sql instances list --project $project_id --format json \
  | jq -r '.[] | .name + "," + .serviceAccountEmailAddress'
```

To grant the read permission,

```sh
gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs://$BUCKET_NAME \
  --role=roles/storage.objectViewer \
  --member=serviceAccount:$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
```

## Concepts

### Service account

- best practices
  * follow a naming and documentation convention
  * create single purpose service accounts
  * rotate service account keys often
  * disable un-used service accounts
  * before deleting service accounts, disable them

### Authentication on GCP

![authentication options on GCP](./images/authentication_on_gcp.webp)

### Logging

- [Logging query
  language](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/logging-query-language)
  - case-insensitive, with the exception of regular expressions
  - JSON null value are expressed as `NULL_VALUE`
  - `a OR NOT b AND NOT c OR d` is equivalent to
    `(a OR (NOT b)) AND ((NOT c) OR d)`
  - `a=b AND c=d AND NOT e=f` is equivalent to
    `a=b c=d -e=f`
  - `AND`, `OR` and `NOT` can be used by all filters
  - `AND` and `NOT` can be used by filters in a log view
  - to combine AND and OR rules in the same expression, you must nest the rules
    using parentheses
  - boolean operators always need to be capitalized
    * Lowercase `and`, `or`, and `not` are parsed as search terms
  - operators
    - `=`           -- equal
    - `!=`          -- not equal
    - `> < >= <=`   -- numeric ordering
    - `:`           -- "has" matches any substring in the log entry field
    - `=~`          -- regular expression search for a pattern
    - `!~`          -- regular expression search not for a pattern

  Explorer](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/logs-explorer-interface)

### Monitoring

- metrics
  * alignment period
    + it is a look-back interval from a particular point in time; the aligner is
      the function that combines the points into the look-back interval into an
      aligned value.
      + example
        + when the alignment period is five minutes, at 1:00 PM, the alignment
          period contains the samples received between 12:55 PM and 1:00 PM. At
          1:01 PM, the alignment period slides one minute and contains the
          samples received between 12:56 PM and 1:01 PM.
  * duration (or duration window)
    + it is used to prevent a condition from triggering due to a single
      measurement or forecast
    + metric-threshold conditions
      + trigger when, for a single time series, every aligned measurement in
        a duration window (say 15 minutes) violates the threshold
    + metric-absence conditions
      + trigger when no data arrives for a time series in a duration window (say
        15 minutes)
    + forecast conditions
      + trigger when every forecast produced during a duration window (say 15
        minutes) predicts that the time series will violate the threshold within
        the forecast window

### Cloud Trace

- a distributed tracing system for Google Cloud
- it collects latency data from App Engine, HTTP(S) load balancers, and
  applications instrumented with the Cloud Trace API
- it shows application's dependencies
- it is not [Cloud Porfiler](https://cloud.google.com/profiler/docs)
- it only supports Linux
- it consists of a tracing client, which collects traces and sends them to your
  Google Cloud project
- using OpenTelemetry is easier and it implements batching which might improve
  performance
- it is a VPC Service Controls supported service
- a trace describes the time it takes an application to complete a single
  operation.
  - each trace consists of one or more spans
    * a span describes how long it takes to perform a complete sub-operation
- cost is based on number of traces involved

### Pub/Sub

- life of a message
  * A publisher sends a message
  * the message is written to storage
  * Pub/Sub sends an acknowledgement to the publisher that it has received the
    message and guarantees its delivery to all attached subscriptions
  * at the same time as writing the message to storage, Pub/Sub delivers it to
    subscribers
  * subscribers send an acknowledgement to Pub/Sub that they have processed the
    message
  * once at least one subscriber for each subscription has acknowledged the
    message, Pub/Sub deletes the message from storage
- publisher
  * the maximum size of a `base64`-decoded message is 10Mb
  * message cannot be empty and must be a valid JSON object with at least one
    attribute (property)
  * batching of publishing message should be turn off (or batch number = 1) in
    most of the use cases (except streaming)
    + this is particularly important when ordering key is used
  * ordering is only guaranteed in region level
    + no global endpoint should be used
      + this implies publishers and subscribers need to be configured to use
        regional endpoints to ensure messages are routed to the correct region
  * messages of a topic with no subscription will be discarded
  * messages expired after the retention period will be discarded and no dead
    letter will be generated
  * message is encrypted by proxy layer by the time it is being sent to a topic
  * when a message reaches Pub/Sub, forwarder initially writes the message to
    `N` clusters (where `N` is an odd number) and consider the message persisted
    when it has been written to at least `N/2` clusters. Once a message is
    persisted, the publishing forwarder acknowledges receipt of the message back
    to the publisher
- subscriber
  * consumer of subscriber message needs to handle idempotency and duplication
    as publisher is not guaranteed to deliver the same message only once (but at
    least once)
    + Dataflow can be incorporated to de-duplicate messages
  * multiple subscribers to the same subscription implies message will be
    load-balanced across the subscribers and each subscriber receiving a subset
    of the messages
  * subscription can be expired after 31 days (default) of inactivity and it can
    be configured to never expire
  * push subscriber requires a public DNS name and a non-self-signed SSL
    certificate (effectively `https`)
  * consumer of a pull subscriber can configure acknowledgement period
  * a push subscribe automatically controls the rate of push according the
    responses it received from previous pushes
    + it starts with push one message and, if it succeed, it pushes double the
      amount in the next push; the amount continue to increase until it gets
      feedback of error code from the other end
  * by default, client libraries default to use streaming pull (asynchronous)
    + in case capability of the client is low, synchronous pull should be used
      to control number of messages to be processed to prevent over-delivery
    + it is advised to configure maximum outstanding messages to avoid one
      consumer being overloaded and the other being idle
  * if a push subscriber is a Cloud Function, configuring IAM would be enough
    for authentication
  * subscription retry policies
    + [Handle message
      failures](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/handling-failures) -
      including dead-letter topic
    + immediate redelivery (default)
    + exponential backoff
      + exponential backoff is only applied per-message, rather than to all the
        messages in a subscription
  * acknowledgement deadline (lease) management
    + high-level client libraries provide lease management as a feature that
      automatically extends the deadline of a message that has not yet been
      acknowledged. By default, the client libraries can extend the deadline to
      an hour by issuing periodic `modifyAckDeadline` requests. The high-level
      client libraries for Python, Go, Java, and .Net use the `99th` percentile
      of acknowledgement delay to determine the length of each extension
    + acknowledgement deadlines are not guaranteed to be respected unless you
      enable exactly-once delivery
  * exactly-once delivery
    + unique message ID is required
    + it has significantly higher publish-to-subscribe latency compared to
      regular subscriptions
- internal architecture
  * data plane
    + moving messages between publishers and subscribers
    + servers in this plane are called forwarders
      + any forwarder is capable of serving clients for any topic or
        subscription (publishing forwarder and subscribing forwarder)
      + publishing forwarder
        + has a list of all subscriptions that are attached to a topic
        + it is responsible for persisting both the published messages and the
          metadata describing which messages have been acknowledged by each
          subscription.
        + the set of messages received and stored by a publishing forwarder for
          a particular topic, along with this tracking of acknowledged messages,
          is called a "publish message source."
      + subscribing forwarder
        + Subscribers receive messages by connecting to subscribing forwarders,
          forwarders through which messages flow to subscribers from publishers.
          “Connecting” in the case of a pull subscriber means issuing a pull
          request. “Connecting” in the case of a push subscriber means having
          the push endpoint registered with Pub/Sub. Once a subscription is
          created, it is guaranteed that any messages published after that point
          will be delivered to that subscription, what we call a sync-point
          guarantee.
    + acknowledgement
      + Once a subscriber processes a message, it sends an acknowledgement back
        to the subscribing forwarder. The subscribing forwarder relays this
        acknowledgement to the publishing forwarder, which stores the
        acknowledgement in the publish message source. Once all subscriptions on
        a topic have acknowledged a message, the message is asynchronously
        deleted from the publish message source and from storage.
  * control plane
    + assignment of publishers and subscribers to servers on the data plane
    + servers in this plane are called routers
      + router provides the client with an ordered list of forwarders it can
        consider connecting to
        + this ordered list may change based on forward availability and the
          shape of the load from the client

    + all messages before the seek time will be considered as acknowledged
  * past time
    + effectively replaying previously acknowledged messages
    + options

        + states of acknowledgement remains as at the time the snapshot is made
        + it respects retention setting
        + allow replaying un-acknowledged message at the time the snapshot is
          made
        + a snapshot should be take before a deployment of new code

- retention
  - topic level
    - maximum at 31 days
    - it is done regardless of a message has been consumed or not
  - subscription level
    - maximum at 7 days
- ordering
  * requirements
    + ordering key is set in a message
    + ordering is enabled in a subscription
  * properties
    + order
      + message published in the same region will be received in the same order
    + consistent redelivery
      + If a message is redelivered, then all messages received after that
        message for the same ordering key will also be redelivered, whether or
        not they were already acknowledged.
    + affinity
      + for streaming pull subscriber, if there are messages with an ordering
        key to a subscriber, the additional messages will be delivered to the
        same subscriber. If there are no outstanding messages, the service
        delivers messages to the last subscriber to receive messages for that
        key on a best-effort basis
- [Pub/Sub code samples](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/samples)
- Cloud Storage as subscriber (sink)
  * Dataflow needs to be setup which requires either Java or python
- comparison with Kafka
  * Kafka requires configuration of number of partitions for each topic whereas
    Pub/Sub autoscales itself
  * Kafka has message de-duplication out of the box whereas Pub/Sub requires the
    use of Dataflow
  * Kafka as dead-letter queue since `2.0`
  * Kafka supports stream processing via `KSQL` whereas Pub/Sub via Dataflow
  * Kafka has not hard limit on messages size whereas Pub/Sub limits to `10MB`
    + the workaround is to use Cloud Storage to store the messages
  * cost of Kafka is based on cost of machines, disk, networking, data ingress
    and egress whereas Pub/Sub is based on data transferred from publishers and
    to subscribers, and the cost of temporarily storing un-acknowledged messages
  * Kafka supports the following authentication methods
    + client certificates
    + Kerberos
    + LDAP
    + username and password
  * Kafka use ACLs for authorization
- migrate from Kafka to Pub/Sub
  * Pub/Sub Kafka connectors can be used to forward messages of a Kafka topic to
    a Pub/Sub topic
- Pub/Sub Lite
  - it is mostly for real-time event processing
  - it does not support push subscribers
  - it is not as "managed" as Pub/Sub
  - it is closer to the model of running Kafka

### VPC

- VPC peering
  * Custom routes of a VPC needs to be explicitly exported and imported during
    peering setup
  * Peering between VPC `A` and VPC `B` and between VPC `B` and VPC `C` do not
    imply peering between VPC `A` and VPC `C`

### Cloud NAT

- [Overview](https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/overview)
- Cloud NAT provides outgoing connectivity for the following resources
  * Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instances without external IP addresses
  * Private Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters
  * Cloud Run instances through Serverless VPC Access
  * Cloud Functions instances through Serverless VPC Access
  * App Engine standard environment instances through Serverless VPC Access
- Cloud NAT is a distributed, software-defined managed service. It's not based
  on proxy VMs or appliances
- it powers a VPC network so that it provides source network address translation
  (source NAT or SNAT) for VMs without external IP addresses
- If the network interface has an external IP address assigned to it, Google
  Cloud automatically performs one-to-one NAT for packets whose sources match
  the interface's primary internal IP address because the network interface
  meets the Google Cloud internet access requirements
- For GKE clusters, Cloud NAT can provide service even if the cluster has
  external IP addresses in certain circumstances
- Each Cloud NAT gateway is associated with a single VPC network, region, and
  Cloud Router. The Cloud NAT gateway and the Cloud Router provide a control
  plane—they are not involved in the data plane, so packets do not pass through
  the Cloud NAT gateway or Cloud Router.
- Cloud NAT relies on custom static routes whose next hops are the default
  internet gateway
  * Each VPC network starts with a default route whose destination is
    `0.0.0.0/0` and whose next hop is the default internet gateway
  * Cloud NAT does not work when
    + a custom static route with next hops set to any other type of custom
      static route next hop (which is not the default internet gateway)
    + a custom static route whose next hop is a Cloud VPN tunnel
    + an on-premises router advertises a custom dynamic route to a Cloud Router
      managing a Cloud VPN tunnel or Cloud Interconnect attachment (VLAN)
- Cloud NAT does not have any Google Cloud firewall rule requirements. Firewall
  rules are applied directly to the network interfaces of Compute Engine VMs,
  not Cloud NAT gateways.
  * When a Cloud NAT gateway provides NAT for a VM's network interface,
    applicable egress firewall rules are evaluated as packets for that network
    interface before NAT. Ingress firewall rules are evaluated after packets
    have been processed by NAT.
- Using a Cloud NAT gateway does not change the amount of outbound or inbound
  bandwidth that a VM can use
- Manual assignment of public IP address to a gateway is possible
- Cloud NAT never performs NAT for traffic sent to the select external IP
  addresses for Google APIs and services
- Cloud NAT does not apply to shared VPC by default
  * shared VPC ties to a host project; Cloud NAT gateway has to configured in
    that project
- A Cloud NAT gateway created in one VPC network cannot provide NAT to VMs in
  other VPC networks connected by using VPC Network Peering, even if the VMs in
  peered networks are in the same region as the gateway.
- A Cloud NAT gateway can perform NAT for nodes and Pods in a private cluster,
  which is a type of VPC-native cluster
  * the following needs to be covered
    + Subnet primary IP address range (used by nodes)
    + Subnet secondary IP address range used for Pods in the cluster
    + Subnet secondary IP address range used for Services in the cluster
  * The simplest way to provide NAT for an entire private cluster is to
    configure a Cloud NAT gateway to apply to all of the cluster's subnet's IP
    address ranges.
- For non-private GKE cluster, since nodes have external IP addresses, packets
  sent from the node's primary internal IP address are never processed by Cloud
  NAT. However, packets sent from Pods can be processed by a Cloud NAT gateway
  if both of the following are true
  * the Cloud NAT gateway is configured to apply to the secondary IP address
    range for the cluster's Pods
  * the cluster's IP masquerade configuration is not configured to perform SNAT
    within the cluster for packets sent from Pods to the internet (see
    [Configuring an IP masquerade agent in Standard
    clusters](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/ip-masquerade-agent))
